It argues that these periodicals provide an opportunity to reconsider the current priorities in the historiography of eighteenth-century political thought and religious history. Having considered the contexts from which the periodicals emerged and the importance of a perceived growth in catholic proselytizing in the 1730s, it analyses the importance of ‘popery’ in religious and political discourse. Taken together, popery and private judgement provided the parameters to descibe what was termed ‘consistent protestantism’ and this was used to defend a particular version of dissent. The protestant aspect to oppositional whiggery has been largely ignored, particularly by those keen to assert the centrality of ‘classical republicanism’ to opposition language in the early Hanoverian period. This article suggests an alternative account of the transmission of the commonwealth tradition and indicates further lines of inquiry into the evolution of whig ideas.</jats:p>",

Although expert assessment of cheese characteristics is widely used, the effect of training in sensory analysis on mastication patterns, as assessed using EMG is not well known. Nine samples of the same Mahon cheese (60 days ripening) were given to 24 subjects (8 experts, 16 untrained) and EMG recorded for each chewing sequence. Three samples were tested in a single session by each subject, and three sessions carried out on different days. EMG was recorded from four masticatory muscles for each subject. From EMG records the following was extracted: number of chews, chewing time, mean and maximum voltage of EMG bursts (i.e. chews) across chewing sequence, chewing work and chewing rate. No gender bias was found for the EMG parameters considered, therefore, as regards gender, each group was considered to be homogeneous. Variability within-subjects across samples was greater for experts than untrained subjects. Significant differences in chewing time, chewing work and chewing rate were found between the expert and untrained groups. Data analysis of the three sessions showed an influence of cognitive constructs, mediating states, on the chewing process. The experts were found to be goal driven as to their mastication process. Experts showed no significant differences between sessions, untrained subjects were found to vary their EMG output in successive sessions for number of chews, chewing time, mean voltage, and chewing work.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The linear receptivity of a swept-wing three-dimensional boundary layer is studied \nexperimentally and theoretically. Cross-flow instability normal modes are excited by \nmeans of surface vibration or roughness perturbations. The resulting disturbances are \ninvestigated, and the normal modes are linked to the source perturbations. Experiments \nare performed under controlled disturbance conditions with a time-harmonic \nsource that is localized in the spanwise direction. A localized surface vibration is \nused to excite wave trains consisting of cross-flow instability waves. Normal oblique \nmodes (harmonic in time and space) are obtained by Fourier decomposition of \nthe wave trains. This provides the spatial variation of the normal modes and, in \nparticular, the initial amplitudes and phases of the modes at the source location. \nThe shape of the surface vibrator is measured and used to determine the complex \nreceptivity coefficients for the normal modes (i.e. for various spanwise wavenumbers, \nwave propagation angles, and disturbance frequencies – including zero frequency). \nThe experimental receptivity coefficients are independent of the specific shape of \nthe surface non-uniformities and can be directly compared with calculations. The \ntheoretical work is based on a linear approximation to the disturbance source – valid \nfor small forcing amplitudes. Like earlier studies on roughness-induced receptivity, the \nbasic flow is locally assumed to satisfy the parallel-flow approximation. The modal \nresponse for the cross-flow instability is determined from the residue associated with \nthe least-stable eigenmode.</jats:p><jats:p>A detailed quantitative comparison between the experimental and theoretical \nreceptivity characteristics is carried out. Good agreement is found for the \nroughness–vibrational receptivity coefficients of the swept-wing boundary layer (especially for the \nmost-unstable cross-flow modes) over a range of disturbance frequencies and spanwise \nwavenumbers. The theory correctly predicts the initial spectra for the travelling \nand stationary cross-flow instabilities excited by the surface vibrations and surface \nroughness, respectively. The good agreement between theory and experiment suggests \nthat the linear receptivity theory can be used effectively in engineering methods for \ntransition prediction. The experimental data can also be used for validation of other \ntheoretical approaches to the problem.</jats:p>",

However, a stepwise variation in \nthe frequency at which peak base drag occurs is found even at these higher Reynolds \nnumbers.

This decline has repercussions not simply for a musical style, but additionally for the privileged subjects who are both the producers and consumers of that music: predominantly white, middle-class males. A number of different strategies have emerged which attempt to develop new positions for these white suburbanites to occupy in the contemporary music-cultural terrain in order to re-assert their hegemony as both producers and consumers. On the producers' side, the most common strategy has been to develop hybrid forms which combine rock with styles of its musical competitors – most notably, of hip hop music and culture. On the consumer side, the response has been the emergence of a ‘neo-eclectic’ form of listening where a number of formerly disparate or even hostile musical forms are consumed by a single (white suburban) individual.</jats:p>",

Although summer temperatures are equatorial, the January mean is only 15.8 °C,and the absolute minimum recorded at sea level is 0 °C (Dudgeon &amp; Corlett 1994).

The most dramatic changes occur in the bird fauna, with the majority of species migratory (Carey <jats:italic>et al.</jats:italic> 2001). The winter fruiting peak in secondary shrublands and the forest understorey coincides with the arrival of partially frugivorous migrant robins and thrushes (Corlett 1993).

Robertsonian, whole‐arm rearrangements account for the twofold range of diploid numbers in <jats:italic>Planipapillus</jats:italic>. <jats:italic>Ooperipatellus</jats:italic> Ruhberg 1985, another clade of oviparous onychophorans, shows a very different pattern, with no karyotypic diversity among species from Australia and New Zealand. Rate constancy in chromosomal evolution among peripatopsid genera would indicate an ancient radiation in <jats:italic>Planipapillus</jats:italic>, with extant species representing relictual survivors of more recent Pleistocene climatic upheavals. Conversely, if the rearrangements in <jats:italic>Planipapillus</jats:italic> are the result of recent and rapid karyotypic restructuring, the karyotypic and species diversity within the genus may be attributed to recent population fragmentation and isolation resulting from the repeated glaciation and warming cycles of the Pleistocene rather than stemming from a more ancient radiation.

Its reception and display were symptomatic of contemporary changes in the physical sites of politics, sharing features with later, more overtly nationalist exhibitions and suggesting a symbiotic relationship between culture and ideology. The reception history of the monument to Verdi built on this occasion, however, warns against historical generalizations, underlining the contingency of the interactions between art, politics and ideology, and demonstrating that current concerns with nationalism often obscure more than they clarify.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The analyses and interpretations that the social sciences have been making in recent decades on the theme of common property call for a fresh look at the history of the commons. Such a vision no longer considers them as resources necessarily destined to disappear, but rather attempts to discover what forces have acted on their historical trajectory. From this perspective, this paper analyses the evolution of common lands in Spain over the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. To that end, it rests on an interpretative proposal that, over time, common lands in Spain have experienced an alteration in their economic usefulness and have had to transform themselves in order to adapt to changing situations. In this context, the various agricultural and, indeed, general economic conjunctures, the evolution of social forces, as well as the make-up of the political system, have all played a major part in the greater or lesser persistence of the commons, in their forms of use and in their more or less successful adaptation to new situations.</jats:p>",

The similarities in these early events of uterine receptivity and placentation go further than mere contact between opposing surfaces however. A considerable body of evidence indicates that the behaviour of the plasma membrane of uterine epithelial cells during early pregnancy has many common aspects across species including humans.

At 3, 6, 9 and 12 h following injection of pig or mouse spermatozoa or isolated sperm heads, the oocytes were fixed and stained with propidium iodide. Between 3 and 6 h following injection, both porcine and murine sperm chromatin developed into pronuclei. The male and female pronuclei were apposed within 12 h in porcine oocytes following sperm injection from either source. We also introduced foreign mitochondria from either mouse or pig sperm midpiece into porcine oocytes following sperm injection. While porcine sperm mitochondria rapidly disappeared from the actively developing porcine oocytes, mouse sperm mitochondria remained in the embryos until the 8-cell stage. These results suggest that pronuclear formation and movement occur between 6 and 12 h following sperm incorporation into the cytoplasm, and that foreign mitochondria are selectively removed in a species-specific manner.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In the UK, hen harriers (<jats:italic>Circus cyaneus</jats:italic>) are illegally killed on moorland that is managed for red grouse (<jats:italic>Lagopus lagopus scoticus</jats:italic>), and they produce fewer young per female on grouse moorland than on either unmanaged moorland or forestry. However, those breeding attempts on grouse moorland that escape nest destruction produce more young than in other land‐use classes. One explanation for this difference is that food is more available to harriers on managed moorland than elsewhere. To examine this hypothesis, we compared the capture rates of hunting male harriers on sites across Scotland. Four of these sites were managed for grouse whilst the remaining three consisted of either unmanaged moorland or a mixture of unmanaged moorland and young forestry plantations. We found a significant difference in capture rates, with harriers on managed grouse moorland capturing prey at a greater rate than elsewhere, supporting the idea that prey were more available on grouse moorland. However, there was no difference in strike rates between the land‐use classes, suggesting that prey were not necessarily more abundant on grouse moors. Males on unmanaged moorland tended to catch larger prey, though this was insufficient to compensate fully for the reduced capture rates. The improved hunting success on grouse moorland means that this habitat is likely to be more attractive to breeding harriers, thereby increasing the conflict between those interested in maximizing grouse numbers and those interested in conserving rare raptors.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>When females are inseminated by more than one male (polyandry) sexual selection continues after insemination in the form of sperm competition and cryptic female choice. The sexually‐selected sperm hypothesis proposes that, under the risk of sperm competition, additive variation in male traits determining fertilising effciency will select for female propensity to be polyandrous in order to increase the probability of producing sons with superior fertilising effciency. Two factors complicate this prediction: sex‐biased transmission of male fertilising effciency traits and sexual antagonism of sex‐limited traits, fostered by sexbiased inheritance. Here, we (i) review the evidence that male traits contributing towards fertilising effciency are heritable through sex‐biased mechanisms, and (ii) explore the evolutionary implications for male and female reproductive strategies caused by both sex‐biased transmission and sexual antagonism of fertilising effciency traits. Many male fertilising effciency traits are heritable through sex‐biased mechanisms and may not necessarily increase female fitness. The predictions of the sexually‐selected sperm hypothesis change dramatically under these different mechanisms of inheritance of fertilising effciency traits, and different fitness pay‐offs derived by females from the expression of such traits. Both sex‐biased control of fertilising effciency and sexual antagonism may also be important in explaining the maintenance of the genetic variance and selection potential of fertilising effciency. We propose that a useful approach to test the sexually‐selected sperm hypothesis is to combine studies which identify behavioural and physiological mechanisms explaining variation in reproductive success with artificial selection experiments to infer the underlying evolutionary patterns.</jats:p>",

Commentators have traditionally seen social democracy as the friend of social welfare. More recently, the virtuous liaison of social democratic politics with successful democratic welfare capitalism has been called into question. Welfare states face pressures from economic globalisation, population ageing, spending constraint and changes in labour markets and in family patterns; it is argued that traditional social democratic approaches find it difficult to pursue policies that will enable welfare states to adapt and continue to combine high social standards with economic growth in the changed conditions of the twenty-first century. In short, the social democratic welfare state is outmoded.</jats:p>",

Giddens (2001: 1) writes that, ‘Across the world left of centre governments are attempting to institute third way programmes – whether or not they favour the term itself. ‘ He claims that there are self-declared third way parties in power in the UK, New Zealand, Korea, Taiwan, Brazil, Argentina and Chile, among many other countries. Similarly, according to Blair (2001), the ideas associated with the TW are still the wave of the future for progressive politics. From Latin America to Europe to parts of Asia, TW politics or ‘progressive government’ is exerting a huge influence on global politics. The TW is seen as a trailblazer for a new global social policy, a new model for a new millennium (e.g. McGuire, 1998/9). One of the main blueprints for the new politics (Giddens, 1998) has been translated into many languages. A number of international meetings in Paris and Florence have discussed the TW. British Prime Minister Tony Blair and German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder issued a joint paper, ‘The Third Way/Die Neue Mitte’ (Blair and Schröder, 1999) that was drafted by Peter Mandelson and Bodo Hombach. Hombach's book has been translated into English as ‘The New Centre’ (Hombach, 2000), with a preface by Tony Giddens and an introduction by Mark Leonard.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In Sweden, youth matters increasingly form a political field of their own. Youth politics may be related to governance and policy research on the one hand, and research on young people's lives on the other. Both have been influenced by similar questions, concerning the freedom of actors and the power of structures. Research specifically on youth politics is however scanty, in Sweden and internationally. The article analyses recent Swedish youth politics, based on interviews with local politicians and officials. Questions posed are: Which youth matters are prioritised at the local political agenda, and why? How is the division of responsibilities in youth matters between different actors perceived? Which importance and functions are attributed to local youth projects? To what extent do recent youth politics mirror late-modern assumptions of self-governance, individual choice and risk-taking? To what extent do they reflect assumptions of an earlier dominant social welfare paradigm? It is concluded that local youth politics in general contain elements of collectivist welfare thinking, and a neo-liberal or post-modern ideology is barely visible. Nevertheless, flexibility, autonomy and decentralisation assumptions about local authorities and young people become more prominent around youth projects. The municipality is also more likely to be identified as a strategic, risk-taking actor here.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The diagnostic meaningfulness of patch tests with house dust mite allergens is still questionable. Our own impression has been that positive results with a dermatophagoides mix may occur preferentially in patients with a generally enhanced responsiveness to contact allergens. To check this, all of our patients allocated to patch testing with the standard series were additionally patch tested with a dermatophagoides mix by the same technique that was used for standard contact allergens. Out of 571 patients tested, 188 showed delayed responses to this mix that were indistinguishable from typical allergic patch test reactions but of no apparent clinical relevance. No relationship was found between positive dermatophagoides patch tests and an atopic disposition of the patients or characteristics of their eczema. However, 64.4% of the patients with a positive dermatophagoides patch test showed a response to at least 1 contact allergen of the standard series, compared to only 56.4% of the patients without a positive dermatophagoides reaction (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05). The reactivity to the mite mix was not related to the responsiveness towards any particular contact allergens. We suppose that some unidentified factors may contribute to positive reactions to the dermatophagoides mix that may also favour an enhanced general responsiveness to contact allergens.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Lyral® 5% pet. was tested in 3245 consecutive patch test patients in 20 departments of dermatology in order (i) to check the diagnostic quality of this patch test preparation, (ii) to examine concomitant reactions to Lyral and fragrance mix (FM), and (iii) to assess the frequency of contact allergy to Lyral in an unselected patch test population of German dermatological clinics. 62 patients reacted to Lyral, i.e. 1.9%. One third of the positive reactions were + + and + + + . The reaction index was 0.27. Thus, the test preparation can be regarded a good diagnostic tool. Lyral and fragrance mix (FM) were tested in parallel in 3185 patients. Of these, 300 (9.4%) reacted to FM, and 59 (1.9%) to Lyral. In 40 patients, positive reactions to both occurred, which is 13.3% of those reacting to FM, and 67.8% of those reacting to Lyral. So the concordance of positive test reactions to Lyral and FM was only slight. Based on these results, the German Contact Dermatitis Research Group (DKG) decided to add Lyral 5% pet. to the standard series.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Ca2+ uptake by mitochondria is a potentially important buffering system able to control cytosolic [Ca2+]. In chromaffin cells, we have shown previously that stimulation of either Ca2+ entry or Ca2+ release via ryanodine receptors triggers large increases in mitochondrial [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]M) approaching the millimolar range, whose blockade dramatically enhances catecholamine secretion [Montero, Alonso, Carnicero, Cuchillo-Ibañez, Albillos, Garcia, Carcia-Sancho and Alvarez (2000) Nat. Cell Biol. 2, 57–61]. In the present study, we have studied the effect of stimulation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) receptors using histamine. We find that histamine produces a heterogeneous increase in [Ca2+]M, reaching peak levels at approx. 1μM in 70% of the mitochondrial space to several hundred micromolar in 2–3% of mitochondria. Intermediate levels were found in the rest of the mitochondrial space. Single-cell imaging experiments with aequorin showed that the heterogeneity had both an intercellular and a subcellular origin. Those mitochondria responding to histamine with increases in [Ca2+]M much greater than 1μM (30%) were the same as those that also responded with large increases in [Ca2+]M following stimulation with either high-K+ medium or caffeine. Blocking mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake with protonophores or mitochondrial inhibitors also enhanced catecholamine secretion induced by histamine. These results suggest that some InsP3 receptors tightly co-localize with ryanodine receptors and voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels in defined subplasmalemmal functional units designed to control secretion induced by different stimuli.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The mRNA encoding the β-subunit of the mitochondrial H+-ATP synthase (β-F1-ATPase) is localized in an approx. 150nm structure of the hepatocyte of mammals. In the present study, we have investigated the cis- and trans-acting factors involved in the generation of the ribonucleoprotein complex containing β-F1-ATPase mRNA. Two cis-acting elements (β1.2 and 3′β) have been identified. The β1.2 element is placed in the open reading frame, downstream of the region encoding the mitochondrial pre-sequence of the protein. The 3′β element is the 3′ non-translated region of the mRNA. Complex sets of proteins from the soluble and non-soluble fractions of the liver interact with the β1.2 and 3′β elements. A soluble p88, present also in reticulocyte lysate, displays binding specificity for both the cis-acting elements. Sedimentation and high-resolution in situ hybridization experiments showed that the structure containing the rat liver β-F1-ATPase mRNA is found in fractions of high sucrose concentration, where large polysomes sediment. Treatment of liver extracts with EDTA promoted the mobilization of β-F1-ATPase mRNA to fractions of lower sucrose concentration, suggesting that the structure containing β-F1-ATPase mRNA is a large polysome. Finally, in vitro reconstitution experiments with reticulocyte lysate, using either the full-length, mutant or chimaeric versions of β-F1-ATPase mRNA, reveal that the assembly of the β-F1-ATPase mRNA polysome requires the co-operation of both the cis-acting mRNA determinants. The present study illustrates the existence of an intramolecular RNA cross-talking required for the association of the mRNA with the translational machinery.</jats:p>",

In order to determine the molecular mechanisms governing PPARβ/Δ gene expression, we have isolated and characterized the mouse gene encoding PPARβ/Δ. The gene spans approx. 41 kb and comprises 11 exons of which the six exons located in the 3′-end of the gene are included in all transcripts. Primer-extension and 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends experiments revealed the presence of multiple transcription start points and splice variants, originating from the use of at least four different promoters. One of these transcription start points was found to be used predominantly in all tissues examined. Initiation from this major transcription start point gives rise to a transcript with a 548nt 5′-untranslated leader containing eight upstream AUG codons. We show that the presence of the 548nt leader resulted in a low translational efficiency of the corresponding PPARβ/Δ mRNA and propose, based on structural features of the 5′-untranslated region, that translational initiation may be mediated via an internal ribosome entry site-dependent mechanism.</jats:p>",

CaM inhibits IP3 binding in both the presence and absence of Ca2+ and IP3-induced Ca2+ release in the presence of Ca2+. We have now mapped and characterized a Ca2+-independent CaM-binding site in the N-terminal part of the type 1 IP3R (IP3R1). This site could be responsible for the inhibitory effects of CaM on IP3 binding. We therefore expressed the N-terminal 581 amino acids of IP3R1 as a His-tagged recombinant protein, containing the functional IP3-binding pocket. We showed that CaM, both in the presence and absence of Ca2+, inhibited IP3 binding to this recombinant protein with an IC50 of approx. 2μM. Deletion of the N-terminal 225 amino acids completely abolished the effects of both Ca2+ and CaM on IP3 binding. We mapped the Ca2+-independent CaM-binding site to a recombinant glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the first 159 amino acids of IP3R1 and then made different synthetic peptides overlapping this region. We demonstrated that two synthetic peptides matching amino acids 49–81 and 106–128 bound CaM independently of Ca2+ and could reverse the inhibition of IP3 binding caused by CaM. This suggests that these sequences are components of a discontinuous Ca2+-independent CaM-binding domain, which is probably involved in the inhibition of IP3 binding by CaM.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Decreased activity and enhanced nuclear export of CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein β during inhibition of adipogenesis by ceramide",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>To identify novel molecular mechanisms by which ceramide regulates cell differentiation, we examined its effect on adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Hormonal stimulation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes induced formation of triacylglycerol-laden adipocytes over 7days; in part, via the co-ordinated action of CCAAT-enhancer-binding proteins α, β and δ (C/EBP-α, -β and -δ) and peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ). The addition of exogenous N-acetylsphingosine (C2-ceramide) or increasing endogenous ceramide levels inhibited the expression of C/EBPα and PPARγ, and blocked adipocyte development. C2-ceramide did not decrease the cellular expression of C/EBPβ, which is required for expression of C/EBPα and PPARγ, but significantly blocked its transcriptional activity from a promoter construct after 24h. The ceramide-induced decrease in the transcriptional activity of C/EBPβ correlated with a strong decrease in its phosphorylation, DNA-binding ability and nuclear localization at 24h. However, ceramide did not change the nuclear level of C/EBPβ after a period of 4 or 16h, suggesting that it was not affecting nuclear import. CRM1 (more recently named ‘exportin-1') is a nuclear membrane protein that regulates protein export from the nucleus by binding to a specific nuclear export sequence. Leptomycin B is an inhibitor of CRM1/exportin-1, and reversed the ceramide-induced decrease in nuclear C/EBPβ at 24h. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that ceramide may inhibit adipogenesis, at least in part, by enhancing dephosphorylation and premature nuclear export of C/EBPβ at a time when its maximal transcriptional activity is required to drive adipogenesis.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Transcriptional regulation of the human carboxyl ester lipase gene in THP-1 monocytes: an E-box required for activation binds upstream stimulatory factors 1 and 2",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>The bile salt-stimulated carboxyl ester lipase (CEL) is important for the digestion and absorption of dietary lipids, and is expressed at high levels by the exocrine pancreas and the lactating mammary gland. However, the presence of CEL in human plasma suggests that the role of CEL in lipid metabolism may stretch beyond its function in the intestinal lumen, and possibly include interactions with cholesterol and oxidized lipoproteins to modulate the progression of atherosclerosis. We have used the CEL-expressing human monocytic cell line THP-1 to investigate the transcriptional regulation of the human CEL in monocytes. Analyses of the promoter region revealed that an E-box located at −47/−52 is necessary for CEL expression. Point mutations in the E-box almost completely abolish the transcriptional activity. Electrophoretic mobility-shift assay analyses reveal that the E-box binds the upstream stimulatory factors 1 and 2, and the binding of an upstream stimulatory factor-containing complex in THP-1 cells also requires the presence of a putative nuclear receptor-binding site at −60/−66. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the E-box is also necessary for CEL expression in the pancreas and the mammary gland, although there are tissue-specific requirements for additional activating elements.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>We have recently shown that the regulatory sequence of the uromodulin gene, containing the 3.7kb promoter, exon 1 and a part of exon 2, provided for kidney-specific expression of the reporter lacZ gene in transgenic mice [Zbikowska, Soukhareva, Behnam, Chang, Drews, Lubon, Hammond and Soukharev (2002) Transgenic Res., in the press]. In the present study, we generated transgenic mice harbouring the regulatory sequence of the uromodulin gene to direct the expression of human α1-antitrypsin (α1AT) into urine. Of the 13 founder mice that tested positive by PCR, seven showed the presence of the human protein in their urine. The concentration of the recombinant human (rh) α1AT in the urine, estimated by using ELISA, ranged from 0.5 to 14μg/ml in the F0-generation mice, and reached up to 65μg/ml in the F1 generation. The transgenically produced rh α1AT was found to be N-glycosylated and biologically active. The N-terminal sequence analysis confirmed the identity of the human protein and revealed that the recombinant α1AT was correctly processed with the signal peptide cleaved off. Our results demonstrate for the first time that the uromodulin regulatory sequence provides a very attractive option for the potential large-scale production of functional therapeutic proteins in livestock.</jats:p>",

    "title": "A mammalian Rho-specific guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (p164-RhoGEF) without a pleckstrin homology domain",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Rho GTPases, which are activated by specific guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), play pivotal roles in several cellular functions. We identified a recently cloned human cDNA, namely KIAA0337, encoding a protein containing 1510 amino acids (p164). It contains a RhoGEF-specific Dbl homology (DH) domain but lacks their typical pleckstrin homology domain. The expression of the mRNA encoding p164 was found to be at least 4-fold higher in the heart than in other tissues. Recombinant p164 interacted with and induced GDP/GTP exchange at RhoA but not at Rac1 or Cdc42. p164-ΔC and p164-ΔN are p164 mutants that are truncated at the C- and N-termini respectively but contain the DH domain. In contrast with the full-length p164, expression of p164-ΔC and p164-ΔN strongly induced actin stress fibre formation and activated serum response factor-mediated and Rho-dependent gene transcription. Interestingly, p164-ΔN2, a mutant containing the C-terminus but having a defective DH domain, bound to p164-ΔC and suppressed the p164-ΔC-induced gene transcription. Overexpression of the full-length p164 inhibited M3 muscarinic receptor-induced gene transcription, whereas co-expression with Gβ1γ2 dimers induced transcriptional activity. It is concluded that p164-RhoGEF is a Rho-specific GEF with novel structural and regulatory properties and predominant expression in the heart. Apparently, its N- and C-termini interact with each other, thereby inhibiting its GEF activity.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Aim. To investigate the characteristics and patterns of cannabis and other drug use among long‐term cannabis users in an Australian rural area . Design. Cross‐sectional survey of a \"snowball\" sample of long‐term cannabis users . Setting. The North Coast of New South Wales is an area with high levels of cannabis cultivation and use, and many long‐term users . Participants. The study involved 268 long‐term cannabis users who had regularly used cannabis for at least 10 years . Measurements. A structured interview schedule obtained information on: demographics, social circumstances, patterns of cannabis and other drug use, contexts of use, perceptions about cannabis and legal involvement. Findings. The mean age of the sample was 36 years and 59% were male. The median length of regular cannabis use was 19 years. Most (94%) used two or more times a week and 60% used daily, with a median of two joints per day. Two‐thirds (67%) used cannabis in social settings and two‐thirds grew cannabis for their own use. The most common reasons for using cannabis were for relaxation or relief of tension (61%) and enjoyment or to feel good (27%). The most commonly reported negative effects were feelings of anxiety, paranoia, or depression (21%), tiredness, lack of motivation and low energy (21%) and effects of smoke on the respiratory system (18%). The majority drank alcohol (79%) and over one‐third were drinking at hazardous levels. Most were current (64%) or ex‐tobacco smokers (24%). One‐quarter (25%) had been charged with possession of cannabis, 11% for cultivation and 6% for supply, with non‐drug offences low (8% or less). Overall, three‐quarters (72%) believed that the benefits of cannabis use outweighed the risks, 21% felt there was an even balance, and 7% said cannabis had done them more harm than good. Conclusions. Among long‐term cannabis users in this Australian rural area, cannabis use was an integral part of everyday life and it was primarily used in social situations for the same reasons that alcohol use is used in the wider community.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Abrogation of the fibrotic effect of transforming growth factor‐β in dermal wound healing",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>The growth factor, transforming growth factor‐β1, which under normal circumstances promotes wound healing by stimulating local fibroblasts to produce collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins, has also been implicated as the primary causative agent of fibrosis. Because transforming growth factor‐β1 is capable of stimulating its own production by fibroblasts, its normally beneficial effects may become amplified to the point where excess extracellular matrix accumulation occurs, thereby causing abnormal scarring. Therefore, strategies that block or counter the effects of transforming growth factor‐β1 may be useful in preventing or decreasing fibrosis. One such strategy is the use of glucocorticoid steroids such as dexamethasone, which normally have the opposite effect of transforming growth factor‐β1, namely the impairment of wound healing. When used in conjunction with transforming growth factor‐β1, glucocorticoid steroids may normalize the effect of transforming growth factor‐β1 on collagen synthesis, thereby reducing excessive collagen deposition and fibrosis.</jats:p>",

    "title": "In vitro analysis of fetal fibroblast collagenolytic activity",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Tissue repair in the rabbit fetus is remarkably rapid and occurs without significant inflammation or excessive collagen deposition. The objective of this study was to compare the ability of rabbit fetal and adult fibroblasts to express the matrix metalloproteinases which are thought to be critical to scar tissue remodeling. In vitro, both fetal and adult rabbit fibroblasts express procollagenase messenger RNA in a constitutive manner. Mechanical disruption of fetal fibroblast monolayers caused a twofold increase in procollagenase mRNA. In contrast, the adult rabbit fibroblast procollagenase mRNA remained unchanged. The mRNA data correlated well with enzyme protein levels. Quantitation by immunoprecipitation showed a 2.3‐fold increase in fetal fibroblast procollagenase protein after mechanical injury, whereas the level in adult rabbit fibroblasts remained unchanged. However, it was noted that the constitutive levels of procollagenase mRNA and protein were higher in adult fibroblasts. Analysis of enzyme activity, by means of a fluorogenic substrate, showed that adult fibroblasts had 2.2 times more collagenase activity compared with fetal cells. After mechanical injury, the fetal fibroblast collagenase activity increased 1.3‐fold compared with 1.7‐fold in the adult fibroblasts. In contrast, fetal fibroblast gelatinase activity was 1.25 times greater than in adult cells and increased 1.4‐fold after mechanical injury, whereas the adult profile remained unchanged. Immunolocalization studies indicated that 1 hour after mechanical injury, procollagenase was produced primarily by fibroblasts along the mechanical injury ridge. By 4 hours after injury, the ridge cells began to migrate out into the open area and procollagenase was noted in adjacent cells of both adult and fetal origin. By 12 and 18 hours, all cells throughout the monolayer were expressing procollagenase. These findings show that in vitro fetal fibroblasts actually had lower levels of procollagenase, but higher levels of gelatinase compared with adult fibroblasts. The increased gelatinase expression may explain why fetal wounds do not have excessive collagen accumulation and heal without a visible scar.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Acceleration of dermal tissue repair by angiotensin II",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Angiotensin II is a naturally occurring peptide which has been shown to possess angiogenic properties. In the studies reported here, angiotensin II was shown to increase the proliferation of cultured bovine aortic arch endothelial cells in a concentration‐dependent manner. Acute administration of angiotensin II in Hydron accelerated the repair of dermal injuries in a full‐thickness excisional rat model. Additional studies were done to determine the best vehicle for delivery of angiotensin II to a dermal injury. Several vehicles, including 10% low‐viscosity carboxymethyl cellulose, 4% medium‐viscosity carboxymethyl cellulose, and 3% high‐viscosity carboxymethyl cellulose, were found to be effective in this regard. Daily administration of angiotensin II for days 0 to 4 after injury (day 0 being the time of surgery) was determined to provide the optimal dosage for acceleration of wound repair by angiotensin II. In addition, dose‐response studies indicated that angiotensin II accelerated wound repair in a dose‐dependent fashion with 0.03 and 0.01 µg/rat/day of angiotensin II administered on days 0 to 4 being the minimally effective and no‐effect doses, respectively. Administration of 100 µg/day of angiotensin II in 10% carboxymethyl cellulose for 5 days after injury to animals with impaired healing (steroid‐ and adriamycin‐treated rats and diabetic mice) was also found to accelerate the rate of repair. In conclusion, angiotensin II accelerated the closure of full‐thickness skin injuries in a dose‐dependent manner in normal and impaired animal models.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>An excess in glucocorticoid steroids, either from endogenous or exogenous sources, has been shown to inhibit wound repair. Key to this impairment is a diminution of the inflammatory response to wounding, fibroplasia, capillary formation, reparative tissue collagen accumulation, and wound breaking strength. Because a single local application at operation of nonviable <jats:italic>Staphylococcus aureus</jats:italic> or its peptidoglycan increases all of these processes in normal rats, we hypothesized that nonviable <jats:italic>S. aureus</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>S. aureus</jats:italic> peptidoglycan would each ameliorate glucocorticoid‐induced impaired healing. Sprague‐Dawley male rats aseptically received two 7 cm paravertebral skin incisions and underwent subcutaneous implantation of polyvinyl alcohol sponges. Two glucocorticoids were used: hydrocortisone, 8 mg intramuscularly, daily beginning 1 day before operation and continuing during the postoperative period; or a single dose of a long‐acting preparation of methylprednisolone, 6 or 8 mg intramuscularly, on the day before operation. Controls received intramuscular injections of saline solution at the same respective times. At the time of the operation, one incision and the polyvinyl alcohol sponges on one side of the animal were instilled with saline solution while the incision and sponges on the opposite side were instilled with nonviable <jats:italic>S. aureus</jats:italic> (hydrocortisone study) or <jats:italic>S. aureus</jats:italic> peptidoglycan (two methylprednisolone studies). The data showed that, at postoperative day 7, the single local application at wounding of nonviable <jats:italic>S. aureus</jats:italic> or <jats:italic>S. aureus</jats:italic> peptidoglycan increased wound breaking strength in the control rats by factors of 1.6 in the hydrocortisone experiment and 1.4 and 1.6 in the methylprednisolone studies. These treatments prevented (in hydrocortisone‐treated rats) or mitigated (in methylprednisolone‐treated rats) the glucocorticoid‐induced decrease in wound breaking strength. In addition, these treatments prevented the glucocorticoid‐induced decreases in the inflammatory (largely mononuclear cells) response to wounding and in the accumulation within the polyvinyl alcohol sponge of reparative tissue fibroblasts, capillaries, and collagen.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Products of the eicosanoid pathways, namely prostaglandins and leukotrienes, are known to play a key role in inflammatory and immune responses, as well as other wound cellular activities of wounded tissue. The objective of this study was to determine whether surgically induced intraperitoneal and incisional wounds in the rat express 5‐lipoxygenase and contain binding sites for leukotrienes and whether their levels change during the course of healing. With the use of a specific monoclonal antibody generated against 5‐lipoxygenase, the enzyme was immunohistochemically localized in various wound cells during postsurgical days 2 to 35. The inflammatory cells within the wound were the major cell types containing 5‐lipoxygenase immunoreactive protein, followed by fibroblasts in the incisional and peritoneal fibrous adhesions, striated muscle, and the vasculature. The greatest level of immunostaining was observed during the first 2 weeks after surgery, which decreased to near unwounded levels by day 35. Light microscope autoradiographic binding studies using <jats:sup>3</jats:sup>H‐leukotrienes indicated that the peritoneal/incisional wounds and unwounded tissues contain specific <jats:sup>3</jats:sup>H‐leukotriene C<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> and <jats:sup>3</jats:sup>H‐leukotriene D<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> but not <jats:sup>3</jats:sup>H‐leukotriene B<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> binding sites.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Various tracheal incisions (vertical, horizontal, or window) are used by surgeons for creation of a tracheostomy. The inflammatory response and healing varies with each incision and may contribute to complications such as tracheal stenosis. This study evaluates the effect of these tracheotomies on early stomal wound healing in a rabbit model. Male juvenile New Zealand rabbits underwent tracheotomy, with each animal randomized to the type of tracheal incision used (vertical, horizontal, or window). After recovery, they were killed on postoperative days 2, 4, 6, and 8, with tissue removed for histologic examination. Paraffin‐embedded stomal sections were analyzed quantitatively for amounts of granulation tissue, fibrosis, and epithelization. Groups were compared statistically using chi‐square, ANOVA, Spearman's rho, and Mann‐Whitney U tests with <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> less than 0.05 considered significant. Fibrosis was significantly increased in the vertical and horizontal groups when compared with the window group. This increase was statistically significant between postoperative days 2 and 4 (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05). The amount of granulation tissue was only significantly increased in the window group, whereas no difference was seen in the rate at which epithelization occurred with the various incisions. Vertical and horizontal tracheal wounds have less granulation tissue formation and more fibrosis compared with window tracheotomies during initial wound healing. This could lead to a “safer” tracheostomy tract in the early postoperative period.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>We have previously shown that local application at the time of operation of <jats:italic>Staphylococcus aureus</jats:italic>, nonviable <jats:italic>S. aureus</jats:italic>, its cell wall, or <jats:italic>S. aureus</jats:italic> peptidoglycan accelerates wound healing. We hypothesized that this effect is due to both direct and indirect mechanisms, among which is an increase in the inflammatory response to wounding, resulting in an increase in macrophages, angiogenesis, and fibroblasts. Twenty‐seven Sprague‐Dawley male rats were anesthetized, and two 7‐cm paravertebral skin incisions were made. Four polyvinyl alcohol sponges, two on each side, containing either 100 µl of isotonic saline or 0.5 mg of nonviable <jats:italic>S. aureus</jats:italic> or <jats:italic>S. aureus</jats:italic> peptidoglycan in 100‐µl saline were implanted subcutaneously. Nonviable <jats:italic>S. aureus</jats:italic> or <jats:italic>S. aureus</jats:italic> peptidoglycan (860 µg/cm incision) in 200‐µl saline were inoculated into the incisions at closure. The rats ate a commercial rat chow and drank tap water ad libitum throughout. After days 3 and 7 postwounding, rats were euthanized, and tissues were examined for immunohistochemical features of reparative tissue using ED‐1, Factor VIII, and vimentin antibodies, markers for monocyte/macrophages, endothelial cells, and mesenchymal cells (including fibroblasts), respectively. Incisions treated with nonviable <jats:italic>S. aureus</jats:italic> or <jats:italic>S. aureus</jats:italic> peptidoglycan showed more macrophages along and deep in the wound tract 7 days postoperatively. Nonviable <jats:italic>S. aureus</jats:italic> or <jats:italic>S. aureus</jats:italic> peptidoglycan‐treated sponges were surrounded and penetrated by much larger capsules of reparative tissue than saline‐treated sponges at both 3 and 7 days. Neutrophil influx was much greater in nonviable <jats:italic>S. aureus</jats:italic> or <jats:italic>S. aureus</jats:italic> peptidoglycan‐treated sponges, especially in central regions, and there were many more ED‐1‐stained macrophages in distinct geographic locations, specifically, the more peripheral‐cortical areas. Some clustering of macrophages occurred around areas of invasion by reparative tissue into the surrounding subcutaneous fat and within the interstices of the sponges at the interface between reparative tissue and acute inflammatory cells. In contrast, saline‐treated sponge reparative tissue had significantly fewer macrophages, much thinner and flimsy reparative tissue, with proportionately fewer macrophages clustering centrally. There were many more mesenchymal cells (notably fibroblasts) and new blood vessels and much more reparative collagen in the nonviable <jats:italic>S. aureus</jats:italic> or <jats:italic>S. aureus</jats:italic> peptidoglycan‐ treated sponges. We conclude that local application of nonviable <jats:italic>S. aureus</jats:italic> or <jats:italic>S. aureus</jats:italic> peptidoglycan at wounding induces an increased number and alteration in location of macrophages, increased influx (or proliferation) of mesenchymal cells (notably fibroblasts), and increased angiogenesis and reparative collagen accumulation, as well as increasing the overall acute inflammatory response to wounding.</jats:p>",

Using <jats:italic>Xenopus laevis</jats:italic> as a model system, we and others have shown that the mRNA levels of thyroid hormone receptors and 9‐cis retinoic acid receptors, which form the functional heterodimers with thyroid hormone receptors, are regulated temporally in a tissue‐dependent manner so that high levels of their mRNAs are present in an organ when metamorphosis is occurring. By overexpressing thyroid hormone receptors, 9‐cis retinoic acid receptors, or both into developing <jats:italic>Xenopus</jats:italic> embryos, we have shown that both thyroid hormone receptors and 9‐cis retinoic acid receptors are required for mediating the effects of thyroid hormone on embryo development and precocious but specific regulation of the genes, which are normally regulated by thyroid hormone during metamorphosis. Analyses of the developmental expression of one class of thyroid hormone response genes, which encode extracellular matrix‐degrading metalloproteinases, suggest that extra cellular remodeling plays an important role during tissue remodeling, including cell death (apoptosis) and cell proliferation and differentiation. This effect of extracellular matrix on cell behavior has been supported directly by in vitro primary cell culture experiments, in which intestinal epithelial cells undergo thyroid hormone‐induced apoptosis, just like that during natural metamorphosis.</jats:p>",

Others have suggested that only the Schwann cell lineage of the blastema requires nerves for regeneration and that upon limb denervation, Schwann cells arrest in the cell cycle and produce a factor that inhibits the cycling of the remaining blastema cells. Our objective was to test this Schwann cell inhibitor model. First, pieces of peripheral nerve were implanted into partially denervated (one third of the nerve supply cut) axolotl forelimbs in an attempt to provide sufficient additional Schwann cells to increase the threshold nerve requirement above that provided by the remaining nerves. These limbs showed delayed regeneration in 68% of the cases and mild deformities, as seen by Victoria Blue staining, in 10% of the cases, as compared with control, partially denervated contralateral limbs that received grafts of muscle or frozen/thawed nerve. Second, when pieces of peripheral nerve were implanted into fully innervated newt limbs, blastema formation was limited, and regeneration was delayed in 80% of experimental cases when compared with control, contralateral newt limbs with muscle or frozen/thawed nerve implants. The results support the inhibition model and further link the need for nerves in regeneration to a possible specific requirement by Schwann cells.</jats:p>",

However, oxygen response was distributed bimodally: 35 (27%) subjects showed increased transcutaneous oxygen (mean 14.8 mm Hg), and 97 (73%) experienced a decreased transcutaneous oxygen reading (mean 12.2 mm Hg). Logistic regression analysis did not explain these differences.

    "title": "The risk of transfusion‐acquired CMV infection in seronegative solid‐organ transplant recipients receiving non‐WBC‐reduced blood components not screened for CMV antibody (1984 to 1996): experience at a single Canadian center",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> <jats:bold>BACKGROUND</jats:bold>: The use of CMV‐safe cellular blood components has been recommended for CMV‐sero‐ negative recipients of CMV seronegative (R–D–) solid‐ organ transplants.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:bold>STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS</jats:bold>: The incidence of CMV infection in 281 CMV‐seronegative patients receiving renal, heart, heart–lung, lung, and liver transplants at our center between January 1984 and October 1996 was studied. The blood components that these patients received were neither WBC reduced nor screened for CMV antibody.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:bold>RESULTS</jats:bold>: One hundred thirty‐one of 154 (85.1%) patients receiving organs from CMV‐seropositive donors (R–D+) developed CMV infection compared with three cases of presumptive transfusion‐acquired (TA) CMV infection in 127 R–D– recipients (2.4%) (relative risk, 36.0; 95% CI, 11.8‐110.4). The organ‐specific incidence of TA CMV infection in R–D– patients was as follows: renal, 0 of 57 (0%); heart, 0 of 29 (0%); heart–lung and/or lung, 1 of 6 (16.7%); and liver, 2 of 20 (10%). There was no significant difference in the transfusion requirements of CMV‐infected and ‐uninfected R–D– patients. False‐positive results were often (40%) observed when posttransfusion serum samples were used for determination of the organ donor CMV serostatus.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:bold>CONCLUSION</jats:bold>: The low risk of TA CMV infection observed in transplant patients who received standard blood components in our study should be considered when evaluating the efficacy of programs that provide CMV‐safe blood components for this population.</jats:p>",

    "title": "HIV seroconverting donors delay their return: screening test implications",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> <jats:bold>BACKGROUND</jats:bold>: The yield of HIV p24 antigen testing implemented in March 1996 has been lower than projected. One possible explanation is that HIV seroconverting donors delay their return because of the recent practice of risk behaviors and/or signs and symptoms associated with primary infection.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:bold>STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS</jats:bold>: From a database of 6.8‐million allogeneic donations collected at five U.S. blood centers from 1991 to 1997, 49 HIV, 21 HCV, 32 HTLV, and 44 HBsAg seroconverters with at least three donations were identified. A statistical method was developed to investigate whether the time between a donor's last negative donation and their positive donation was significantly longer than expected based on their previous return history.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:bold>RESULTS</jats:bold>: HIV seroconverters returned on average 42 percent later than expected (p <jats:italic>&lt;</jats:italic> 0.01). Although not significant, HCV seroconverters donated on average 43 percent earlier than expected. HTLV and HBsAg seroconverters did not appear to change their donation pattern around the time of seroconversion. Sixty‐three percent of the HIV seroconverters later acknowledged practicing a high‐risk behavior.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:bold>CONCLUSIONS</jats:bold>: HIV seroconverters delay their return around the time of seroconversion and are thus less likely to be recently infected. Unique among HIV seroconverters, this observation provides a possible explanation for the lower than expected yield of HIV p24 antigen testing and suggests that NAT may have a similar low yield.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> <jats:bold>BACKGROUND</jats:bold>: Intraoperative blood salvage (IBS) is one of several blood‐conservation strategies employed to limit the use of allogeneic blood. IBS with mathematical modeling was studied to gain a better understanding of its benefits and limitations.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:bold>STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS</jats:bold>: Equations, based on a convergent geometric series, allowed the assessment of maximum allowable blood losses to avoid allogeneic RBC exposure in relationship to the fractional recovery of IBS. Such equations allowed us to calculate the potential “savings” in allogeneic RBC volume and to define better the efficiency of IBS.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:bold>RESULTS</jats:bold>: This model predicts that substantial amounts of RBCs (&gt;2 units) can be recovered if there is large blood loss (e.g., &gt;3000 mL) and if the minimal allowable Hct is low (e.g., 21%). As with other blood‐ conservation methods, this article shows that there are limits to the potential benefit of IBS for the avoidance of allogeneic RBC transfusion.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:bold>CONCLUSION</jats:bold>: IBS can be modeled with a convergent geometric series, and the amount of blood loss is dependent on the difference between the patient's starting Hct, the minimum allowable Hct, and the fractional recovery of RBCs. Such modeling illustrates the limited utility of IBS as a sole blood‐conservation strategy.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>A recently developed Floquet theory-based formalism for computing electron transport through a molecular bridge coupled to two metal electrodes in the presence of a monochromatic ac radiation field is applied to an experimentally relevant system, namely a xylyl–dithiol molecule in contact at either end with gold electrodes. In this treatment, a nondissipative tight-binding model is assumed to describe the conduction of electric current. Net current through the wire is calculated for two configurations of the electrode–wire–electrode system. In one, symmetric, configuration, the electrodes are close (∼2 Å) and equidistant from the bridge molecule. In the other, asymmetric configuration, one electrode is farther away (∼5 Å), representing the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope located at this distance from the bridge molecule (the other end being chemisorbed to a gold substrate). For both configurations, electron current is calculated for a range of experimental inputs, including dc bias and the intensity and frequency of the laser. Via absorption/emission of photons, resonant conditions may be achieved under which electron transport is significantly enhanced compared to the unilluminated analog. Calculations show that this can be accomplished with experimentally accessible laser field strengths.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Effects of small-scale turbulent motions on the filtered velocity gradient tensor as deduced from holographic particle image velocimetry measurements",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>The effects of small-scale motions on the inertial range structure of turbulence are investigated by considering the dynamics of the velocity gradient tensor (Ãij) filtered at scale Δ. In addition to self-interactions and the filtered pressure Hessian, the evolution of Ãij is determined by the subgrid-scale stress tensor. As in the so-called restricted Euler dynamics, the evolution equations can be simplified by considering the invariants RΔ and QΔ of Ãij. The effects of the subgrid-scale stress tensor on RΔ and QΔ can be quantified unambiguously by evaluating conditional averages that appear in the evolution equation for the joint probability distribution function of these invariants. The required conditional averages are computed from three-dimensional measurements of fully developed turbulence in a square duct, at Reτ≈2360. The measurements are performed using holographic particle image velocimetry [Tao et al., Phys. Fluids 12, 941 (2000); Tao et al., J. Fluid Mech. 457, 35 (2002)]. The velocity distributions are spatially filtered in the inertial range using a box filter at about 30 Kolmogorov scales to separate large from small scales. The results show that the subgrid scale (SGS) stresses have significant effect on the evolution of filtered velocity gradients. In particular, along the so-called Vieillefosse tail at RΔ&amp;gt;0 and QΔ&amp;lt;0, they oppose the formation of a finite-time singularity that occurs in restricted Euler dynamics. Various other trends are quantified in different parts of the (RΔ,QΔ) plane. Included are the SGS dissipation rate of kinetic energy, and the effect of the SGS stress in modifying the so-called “discriminant,” which is a conserved quantity in restricted Euler dynamics. A priori tests of the Smagorinsky, nonlinear, and mixed models show that all reproduce the real SGS stress effect along the Vieillefosse tail, but that they fail in several other regions. An attempt is made to optimize the mixed model by letting the two coefficients be functions of RΔ and QΔ.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>We report an implementation for the computation of optical rotations within the Amsterdam Density Functional program package. The code is based on time-dependent density functional response theory. Optical rotations have been calculated for a test set of 36 organic molecules with various density functionals, and employing basis sets of different quality. The results obtained in this work with nonhybrid functionals are comparable in quality to those recently reported by other authors for the B3LYP hybrid functional, but show a somewhat larger tendency to produce outlyers. The median error is approximately 20°/(dm g/cm3) for specific rotations [α]D as compared to experimental data (approximately 30% median deviation from experimental values). Thereby it is demonstrated that density functional computations can be employed to assist with the solution of stereochemical problems in case the specific rotations of the species involved are not small and their structures are rigid. Recent newly developed functionals are investigated with respect to their applicability in computations of optical rotations.</jats:p>",

We examine the relationship between mixed structure functions (which are explicitly zero in isotropic flow), and those of the longitudinal and transverse structure functions. Our results confirm recent findings using SO(3) symmetry decomposition [S. Kurien and K. R. Sreenivasan, Phys. Rev. E 62, 2206 (2000)] that show that the mixed structure functions have larger scaling exponents than those of the single component structure functions, i.e., the j=2 anisotropic sector structure function scaling exponent is greater than that of the j=0 isotropic sector. However, we also show that the ratio of the j=2 to j=0 sector scaling exponents systematically decreases with increasing order, suggesting that at higher orders there is persistence of anisotropy at the smallest scales. Difficulties in the analysis due to the difference in scaling exponents of the transverse and longitudinal structure functions are addressed.</jats:p>",

The acoustic waves are interferometrically measured on the surface of polished aluminum samples at distances of 5–40 mm from the excitation spot. Amplitudes of the surface acoustic waves are measured as a function of laser energy (1–60 mJ) and distance from the excitation spot yielding peak-to-peak displacements of 1–40 nm. The results are compared to theoretical calculations using the Green’s function for a step impulse response. The impulse required to match the measured results is compared to the expected impulse based on plasma pressure scaling in the ablative regime and the experimentally measured response is found to agree within a factor of 2 with the theoretical predicted impulse.</jats:p>",

The MLQW consists of a GaAs core wire coated by a AlxGa1−xAs cylindrical shell and embedded in the bulk AlyGa1−yAs. A variational trial wave function is proposed. It is found for a small wire radius that the ground state binding energy of a hydrogenic impurity located at the center of a MLQW behaves very differently from that of a single-layered quantum wire (SLQW). The calculation shows that the binding energy depends on the potential profiles, potential barrier height, impurity position, shell thickness, magnetic field, and the difference between the Al concentration contained in the shell and bulk regions. Our trial function is also able to reproduce the binding energies of a hydrogenic impurity located at the center of a SLQW, good agreement with the previous results is obtained.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Laboratory experiments on decaying quasi-2D (two-dimensional) turbulence have been performed in stratified fluids in both square and circular containers. The turbulence was generated by towing an array of vertical cylinders through the container, which was filled with either a two-layer or a linearly stratified fluid. By varying the grid configuration a different amount of angular momentum could be added to the initial flow. The evolution of the flow was visualized by 2D particle tracking velocimetry. The observed decay scenario has been investigated with emphasis on the evolution of the kinetic energy and the enstrophy of the horizontal flow, vortex statistics and the angular momentum of the flow. In particular it is shown that the experiments in both the square and the circular container support the observations from numerical simulations of decaying 2D turbulence in bounded domains with no-slip walls. Two striking examples are the experimental observation of the spontaneous spin-up phenomenon (in the square-container experiments) and the confirmation that the angular momentum of the flow in the circular-container experiment is better conserved than the total kinetic energy of the flow. The role of the initial nonzero net angular momentum on the decay of quasi-2D turbulence is investigated for both geometries and indications for an acceleration of the self-organization process are presented.</jats:p>",

As model system a composite cylinder with inner heating is considered which reflects the symmetry of the experimentally setup. The general condition for the existence of a potentially unstable stratification in the magnetic fluid is derived. Within a linear stability analysis the critical external induction for the onset of thermomagnetic convection is determined for dilute and nondilute magnetic fluids.

The results of the experiment have shown that the transverse shock wave propagating through Nd2Fe14B causes “hard ferromagnetic-to-paramagnetic” phase transformation terminating by practically complete demagnetization of Nd2Fe14B. Pulse generators based on the transverse shock wave demagnetization of hollow cylindrical Nd2Fe14B samples with diameter of 25.4 mm and length of 19.1 mm are capable of producing high-voltage pulses [peak voltage of 11.3 kV, full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 4.5 μs] and high-current pulses (peak current of 1.93 kA, FWHM of 100 μs, peak power of 27.0 kW).

In addition, results of the adsorption behavior of α-6T molecules on the H-passivated Si(100)-(2×1) surface are reported.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Monte Carlo simulations have been performed to study the arrangement of water molecules between charged surfaces. The molecular water used—the four- point transferable intermolecular potential (TIP4P), together with fluctuating charge (FQ)—constitutes the water model TIP4P-FQ. The TIP4P-FQ features the same molecular frame as the TIP4P model; however, with the former, charges on the molecular sites of the same molecule are allowed to fluctuate in response to their environment. Therefore, the induced dipole moment under an external field is inherently considered in the TIP4P-FQ water model. This feature makes it more useful than multipoint fixed-charge models, such as the TIP4P, in studying water arrangement between charged surfaces. The formation of a few ordering layers of water molecules adjacent to a charged surface is confirmed by (N,V,T) Monte Carlo simulations. The preferable orientation of water molecules in this study is found to be similar to previous findings in the literature, with the oxygen atoms pointing to the positively charged surface (oxygen-down) and the hydrogen atoms pointing to the negatively charged surface (oxygen-up). Modeling results also demonstrate that the dominant orientation at the negatively charged surface is one O–H bond pointing to the surface while another O–H bond is aligned parallel to the charged surface. In addition, simulation results using the TIP4P-FQ water model show that the water density in the interfacial region increases ∼8%–14%, which is lower than the density increase observed in experimental data discussed in the literature.</jats:p>",

The (re)orientation of the OH− ions in the columns and the hydroxyls of the structural H2O molecules give rise to two prominent thermocurrent bands in the temperature range of ∼200–340 K. Several weak current bands, below ∼200 K, are related to the relaxation of impurity–Ca2+ vacancy (I–V) dipoles. The I–V mechanisms are particularly effective in the case where Ep⊥c axis and are considered to take place via cation jumps on planes perpendicular to the [0001] crystal axis, at regions near “distorted” Ca(II) triangles (i.e., triangles which include impurity ions and Ca2+ vacancies). The band attributed to rotational relaxation of the OH− ions in the columns shows particular strength when Ep⊥c axis, and an extensive distribution of relaxation times. The distribution is due to the multiplicity of physicochemical interactions between the OH− ions and their ionic and molecular neighbors (hydrogen bonds with adjacent F−, Cl−, and O2− ions, varying steric hindrances, etc.). The changes induced in the TSDC spectra after annealing processes at selected high temperatures are interpreted based on the gradual loss of structural H2O molecules located in oxygen or calcium vacancies and the resulting local changes in the crystal lattice.</jats:p>",

Dynamics is carried out using the curvilinear coordinates of the Z-matrix so that computation of the potential energy surface and dynamics are coupled.

The efficiency of the Chebyshev expansion of the microcanonical projection operator δ(E−ĤnD) appearing in the quantum expression of NnD(E) is checked.

Three-dimensional modeling of the H/C/N chemistry prevailing in such HF activated gas mixtures allows the relative number density measurements to be placed on an absolute scale. Experiment and theory both indicate that N2 is largely unreactive under the prevailing experimental conditions, but NH3 additions are shown to have a major effect on the gas phase chemistry and composition. Specifically, NH3 additions introduce an additional series of “H-shift” reactions of the form NHx+H⇌NHx−1+H2 which result in the formation of N atoms with calculated steady state number densities &amp;gt;1013 cm−3 in the case of 1% NH3 additions in the hotter regions of the reactor. These react, irreversibly, with C1 hydrocarbon species forming HCN products, thereby reducing the concentration of free hydrocarbon species (notably CH3) available to participate in diamond growth. The deduced reduction in CH3 number density due to competing gas phase chemistry is shown to be compounded by NH3 induced modifications to the hot filament surface, which reduce its efficiency as a catalyst for H2 dissociation, thus lowering the steady state gas phase H atom concentrations and the extent and efficiency of all subsequent gas phase transformations.</jats:p>",

The rate for all the features is, to ±13%, Δν/ν=cn(Ee) where c=−0.027 and n(Ee) is the Bose–Einstein population factor with Ee=860 cm−1. The intensities of the optical absorption involving the creation of two phonons of energies E1 and E2 are expected to increase with T in proportion to [1+n(E1)][1+n(E2)]. This expression, combined with the fractional shift rule for the energies of each mode, allows high temperature two-phonon spectra to be simulated accurately from a low temperature spectrum. The temperature dependence of the three-phonon band between 2665 and 3900 cm−1 is precisely fitted without adjustable parameters by using the shift rule in conjunction with a modified density of three-phonon states. Absorption at 10.6 μm is shown to involve the simultaneous destruction and creation of phonons. Its strong temperature dependence in the range 300&amp;lt;T&amp;lt;800 K is accurately described, without any adjustable parameters, in terms of three main components: the destruction of one phonon of 335 cm−1 and the creation of a second of 1275 cm−1; the shift to lower energy of the phonons; and a three-phonon process involving the destruction of one and the creation of two phonons.

Much attention is paid, in particular, to the impulsive components (streamers and Trichel pulses components) and on the nonimpulsive ones constituting what we call the pseudocontinuous components, generally ignored in the literature. So four different categories of charges are considered: for the positive voltage alternation, a positive-pulse charge (Qimp+) and a positive pseudocontinuous charge (Qcont+) and for the negative alternation, a negative-pulse charge (Qimp−) and a negative pseudocontinuous charge (Qcont−). The article also intends to show how the main electrical parameters (current charge and power) can be determined by different ways and how to select the best way for representative measurements in every situation.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>A new form of surface junction thermocouple sensor has been developed and tested. The novel feature of the design is the use of a tapered fit between two coaxial thermocouple elements to form a thin, robust junction. The gauge has a response time on the order of 1 μs and is suitable for measuring large transient heat fluxes in hypervelocity wind tunnels. Asymptotic analysis is used to demonstrate the operating principles and to assess the errors associated with the finite thickness of the surface junction. Spectral deconvolution methods are used to infer a mean square optimal estimate of the surface heat flux from time resolved surface temperature measurements. This improved signal processing method is applicable to transient heat flux gauges of all types. Potential reducible error sources and other systematic errors are described. Measurements of the heat flux about the forebody of a cylindrical body in a hypervelocity flow demonstrate the functioning of the gauge and are used to obtain statistical estimates of the repeatability of the technique. The measured heat fluxes are compared with established theoretical predictions.</jats:p>",

For the acidic systems we find a dramatic relative shift of the double-ionization spectra to higher energies due to the presence of just one additional proton. The impact of the proton on the ionization spectra is also important, but results in only half of the double-ionization spectra’s shift. A molecular electronic decay mechanism is found to be operative in the valence region of the molecules under investigation. The impact of this decay is more substantial for the anions. The threshold for electronic decay (i.e., the first double-ionization potential) is at much lower energy for the anions than for the acids. Interestingly, the localization pattern of the holes in the decay channels is, in contrast to the decay threshold, only a little affected by protonation. We also compare the impact of electron correlation effects on the ionization and double-ionization spectra of the series of fluorinated carbanions and of their acids.</jats:p>",

The heat of reaction sets up surface tension gradients that induce thermocapillary stresses on the free-surface, thus affecting the evolution of the film. By using a long-wave expansion of the equations of motion and associated boundary conditions, we derive a nonlinear partial differential equation of the evolution type for the local film thickness. We demonstrate that, when the surface tension is an increasing function of temperature an exothermic reaction has a stabilizing effect on the free surface while an endothermic reaction is destabilizing. We construct bifurcation diagrams for permanent solitary waves and show that, in all cases the solution branches exhibit limit points and multiplicity with two branches, a lower branch and an upper branch. Time-dependent computations of the free-surface evolution equation show that the system always approaches a train of coherent structures that resemble the lower branch solitary waves. We also examine the absorption characteristics through the interface and we demonstrate that an endothermic reaction enhances absorption and mass transport.

The model predicts that the reducing effect of the external electric field on the fluorescence quenching alternates with the enhancing effect when the standard free energy change or the donor–acceptor separation is varied.

In the case of an uncapped stack ZrSi and ZrSi2 phases form during an ultrahigh vacuum anneal at temperatures above 900 °C. Both phases show an island-type growth with an epitaxial relationship with Si (100). Gate dielectric stacks with a poly-Si cap are found to be thermally unstable at T=1000 °C, so that the reaction is initiated at the ZrO2/poly-Si interface. Here a different reaction mechanism is identified, which involves the reduction of ZrO2 and the growth of a bottom interfacial layer between ZrOx and Si. Replacement of the bottom SiO2 layer by an ultrathin Si oxinitride does not completely suppress these interfacial reactions at T⩾1000 °C. We suggest that control of the poly-Si/ZrO2 interfacial reactions may be an important factor in modifying the thermal stability of a stack.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The properties of field effect transistors with organic insulator and semiconducting regions, fabricated with a top-gate architecture, have been investigated. Thin films (d≈30 nm) of regioregular poly(3-dodecylthiophene) were employed as the active semiconductor and the gate insulator was formed by a 500-nm-thick layer of poly(4-vinylphenol). Both were solution-processed on top of poly(ethylenetherephthalate) films, which were used as substrates. The output characteristics show a pronounced saturation behavior with an unconventional nonquadratic saturation current dependence on the gate voltage. Hence the (hole) mobility of 0.002–0.005 cm2/Vs has been estimated from the linear region of the transfer characteristics. The transistor turn-on occurs at a threshold voltage of approximately Vth=0 V, and the device can be operated with a supply voltage of between 15 and 20 V. As is usually observed for organic transistors, the inverse subthreshold slope (S) is very high, in our case S≈7 V/dec, by contrast with S≈200 mV/dec obtained for the similar material poly(3-octylthiophene) (P3OT) with silicon dioxide (SiO2) as an insulator. Furthermore, the subthreshold current depends on the drain voltage even though the transistor is electrically a long channel device with L=2 μm, notwithstanding the fact that this channel length is rather small for the present organic devices. To clarify these peculiarities numerical simulations have been carried out with a systematic variation of the relevant material parameters and assuming the existence of interface or bulk trap states. It turns out that both the high inverse subthreshold slope and the drain voltage dependence can be explained by recharging of trap states either at the interface or in the bulk. Considering the difference to the P3OT device with SiO2 as insulator it is proposed that interface traps are responsible for these effects, although one excludes the possibility that the film formation either on an organic substrate or on SiO2 leads to different bulk properties.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>A density functional theory for polymer solutions is generalized to cases where the monomers have a different diameter to the solvent. An appropriate free energy functional is obtained by integration of the generalized Flory equation of state for such systems. This functional predicts that entropic demixing may occur in polymer solutions in which the solvent particles are smaller than the monomers. Demixing is promoted not only by a large size disparity, but also by a high pressure as well as by polymer length. The existence of two separate phases in the bulk solution suggests the possibility of capillary-induced phase transitions, even when the confining surfaces are hard, but otherwise inert. We examine such phase transitions and their relation to surface forces and colloidal stability. The density functional theory also predicts that under certain conditions, layering transitions will occur at hard and flat surfaces. A transition from a thin to a thick polymer-rich surface layer may take place as the separation between two surfaces is decreased, and we study the concomitant change on the surface force. Stable thick phases are predicted even at very large undersaturations, and they give rise to a profound increase of the range and strength of the surface force. We furthermore include comparisons with predictions from a model in which the solvent only enters the description implicitly. Responses of the surface forces to changes in monomer diameter, solvent diameter, polymer density, and chain length are investigated.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The photodissociation dynamics of jet-cooled BrCl molecules have been investigated at four different wavelengths in the range 425–485 nm by high-resolution velocity map ion imaging. Four images of the Cl(2P3/2) atomic fragments are recorded at each photolysis wavelength with the probe laser polarization, respectively, linearly aligned and vertical (i.e., perpendicular to the detection axis), right circularly polarized, horizontally linearly polarized (i.e., parallel to the detection axis) and left circularly polarized on successive laser shots, thereby ensuring automatic mutual self-normalization. Appropriate linear combinations of these images allow quantification of the angular momentum alignment of the Cl(2P3/2o) fragments [i.e., the correlation between their recoil velocity (v) and their electronic angular momentum (J)] in terms of the alignment anisotropy parameters s2, α2, η2, and γ2, and determination of the “alignment-free” recoil anisotropy parameter, β0, as a function of parent excitation wavelength. Both incoherent and coherent contributions to the alignment are identified, with both simultaneous parallel and perpendicular excitations to the B 3Π(0+) and C 1Π(1) states and excitations to the Ω=±1 components of the C state contributing to the latter. The deduced values of the alignment-free β parameters indicate (wavelength dependent) contributions from both parallel and perpendicular parent absorptions in this wavelength range. Such a conclusion accords with approximate deconvolutions of the parent absorption spectrum that are currently available, and with determinations of the orientation parameter γ1′ obtained by fitting the difference image obtained when using left and right circularly polarized radiation to probe the ground state Cl atoms arising in the 480.63 nm photodissociation of BrCl when the photolysis laser radiation is polarized linearly at 45° to the detection axis.</jats:p>",

NFCL contrast observed in round growth hillocks at the sample surface, with a diameter of less than 10 μm, is compared with that observed by conventional cathodoluminescence in scanning electron microscope (CLSEM) techniques. In particular NFCL images reveal features not detected by CLSEM which is explained by the fact that under near field conditions the signal arises from a depth of only several tens of nanometers and is then directly related to the surface hillocks. Diffusion lengths of about 0.4 and 4 μm have been found for the holes in different regions of the samples at room temperature. The order of magnitude of these minority carriers diffusion lengths is in good agreement with previous measurements performed at different GaN samples with other techniques.

Here, transport theory of sputtering is formulated, which includes a more realistic analytical model of the surface in a semi-infinite target. In contrast to the traditional theory, which is based on the linearized Boltzmann equation, the new approach uses the discrete-path master equation for particle transport in matter. Starting from the discrete-path formalism, the deflection of incoming projectiles and focusing of emitted particles when they pass the surface are described by a unified few-collision approach and combined with the bulk master equation through sophisticated boundary conditions.

Ionization energies of 2AP–NH2 and 2AP–ND2 are both precisely and accurately determined to be 8.1086±0.0005 and 8.1027±0.0005 eV, respectively. Two geometrical isomers, 2AP–NHD or 2AP–NDH, of which H or D is hydrogen-bonded to the nitrogen atom on the pyridine ring, respectively, are spectroscopically well isolated using the hole-burning spectroscopy in the S1 states. Corresponding ionization energies are thus separately determined to be 8.1067±0.0005 or 8.1048±0.0005 eV for 2AP–NHD or 2AP–NDH, respectively. Vibrational bands of 2-aminopyridine ions associated with various aromatic ring-skeletal modes are identified in the MATI spectra and appropriately assigned with the aid of ab initio calculation. All of the ring-skeletal vibrational frequencies observed in this work become slightly higher than those in the S1 states when the molecules are ionized, consistent with the fact that the S1–S0 excitation is due to π*–π transition. According to ab initio calculation, the amino group is in the molecular plane both in the S1 and D0 states, while it is slightly distorted in the ground state of 2-aminopyridine. Inversion modes in 2AP–ND2 and 2AP–NDH in S1 states are split into two bands due to their strong coupling with the other mode, which is most probably due to torsional motion of the amino group. Strong mode couplings are clearly manifested in interferencelike patterns observed in vibrational band structures of MATI spectra taken via those two bands in S1 states as intermediate states. A new spectroscopic scheme, in which MATI signals are used for obtaining mode-resolved spectra for the intermediate state is introduced. The vibrational band at 911 cm−1 from the S1–S0 origin that has been previously assigned as the inversion mode of 2AP–NH2 is found to actually consist of two closely-spaced different modes giving two clearly-resolved different Franck–Condon active modes in corresponding MATI spectra.</jats:p>",

The semiconductor quantum wells are studied under magnetic fields applied in the growth direction of the semiconductor heterostructure. The various magnetoexciton states are obtained in the effective-mass approximation by an expansion of the exciton-envelope wave functions in terms of products of hole and electron quantum-well states with appropriate Gaussian functions for the various excitonic states. Intramagnetoexciton transitions are theoretically studied by exciting the allowed excitonic transitions with σ+ (or σ−) far-infrared radiation circularly polarized in the plane of the GaAs-(Ga,Al)As quantum well. Theoretical results are obtained for the intramagnetoexciton transition energies and magneto-absorption spectra associated with excitations from 1s-like to 2p±, and 3p±-like magnetoexciton states, and found in overall agreement with optically detected resonance measurements.</jats:p>",

By means of an asymptotic procedure, solutions are found for small-amplitude two-dimensional elastic shear solitons of the one-parameter stationary-profile type and for envelope solitons and also for surface solitons localized near an ideal surface of an elastic half space.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the major loss mechanisms leading to low energy conversion efficiencies of solar cells is the thermalization of charge carriers generated by the absorption of high-energy photons. These losses can largely be reduced in a solar cell if more than one electron–hole pair can be generated per incident photon. A method to realize multiple electron–hole pair generation per incident photon is proposed in this article. Incident photons with energies larger than twice the band gap of the solar cell are absorbed by a luminescence converter, which transforms them into two or more lower energy photons. The theoretical efficiency limit of this system for nonconcentrated sunlight is determined as a function of the solar cell’s band gap using detailed balance calculations. It is shown that a maximum conversion efficiency of 39.63% can be achieved for a 6000 K blackbody spectrum and for a luminescence converter with one intermediate level. This is a substantial improvement over the limiting efficiency of 30.9%, which a solar cell exposed directly to nonconcentrated radiation may have under the same assumption of radiative recombination only.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper reports a computational method, the quantized elastic deformational model, that can reliably describe the conformational flexibility of a protein in the absence of the amino acid sequence and atomic coordinates. The essence of this method lies in the fact that, in modeling the functionally important conformational changes such as domain movements, it is possible to abandon the traditional concepts of protein structure (bonds, angles, dihedrals, etc.) and treat the protein as an elastic object. The shape and mass distribution of the object are described by the electron density maps, at various resolutions, from methods such as x-ray diffraction or cryo-electron microscopy. The amplitudes and directionality of the elastic deformational modes of a protein, whose patterns match the biologically relevant conformational changes, can then be derived solely based on the electron density map. The method yields an accurate description of protein dynamics over a wide range of resolutions even as low as 15–20 Å at which there is nearly no visually distinguishable internal structures. Therefore, this method dramatically enhances the capability of studying protein motions in structural biology. It is also expected to have ample applications in related fields such as bioinformatics, structural genomics, and proteomics, in which one's ability to extract functional information from the not-so-well-defined structural models is vitally important.</jats:p>",

When challenged, 30–60 days after transfer, with i.v. cytochrome C, the transgenic cells rapidly became activated, expressed mRNA for IFNγ, and began to divide. However, after 48 h, the frequency of the cells fell progressively, reaching levels only slightly above the limit of detection by day 8 and thereafter remain depressed for up to 90 days. The remaining cells were anergic as shown by limitation in proliferation and IFNγ production in response to<jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>antigen stimulation. Even if challenged with antigen emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant, the overall pattern was similar, except that in the draining lymph nodes, the surviving antigen-specific cells were not anergic, although spleen cells were still strikingly anergic. Thus, antigenic challenge of mice possessing resting memory TH1 CD4 T cells leads to the unanticipated loss of most of the specific cells and an apparent depletion rather than enhancement of immunologic memory.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Prp8 is the largest and most highly conserved protein in the spliceosome yet its mechanism of function is poorly understood. Our previous studies implicate Prp8 in control of spliceosome activation for the first catalytic step of splicing, because substitutions in five distinct regions (a–e) of Prp8 suppress a cold-sensitive block to activation caused by a mutation in U4 RNA. Catalytic activation of the spliceosome is thought to require unwinding of the U1 RNA/5′ splice site and U4/U6 RNA helices by the Prp28 and Prp44/Brr2 DExD/H-box helicases, respectively. Here we show that mutations in regions a, d, and e of Prp8 exhibit allele-specific genetic interactions with mutations in Prp28, Prp44/Brr2, and U6 RNA, respectively. These results indicate that Prp8 coordinates multiple processes in spliceosome activation and enable an initial correlation of Prp8 structure and function. Furthermore, additional genetic interactions with U4-cs1 support a two-state model for this RNA conformational switch and implicate another splicing factor, Prp31, in Prp8-mediated spliceosome activation.</jats:p>",

When Photosystem (PS) II is inhibited, a cyclic electron flow around PSI operates transiently at a rate close to the maximum turnover of photosynthesis. When PSII is active, the cyclic flow operates with a similar rate during the first seconds of illumination. The high efficiency of the cyclic pathway implies that the cyclic and the linear transfer chains are structurally isolated one from the other. We propose that the cyclic pathway operates within a supercomplex including one PSI, one cytochrome bf complex, one plastocyanin, and one ferredoxin. The cyclic process induces the synthesis of ATP needed for the activation of the Benson–Calvin cycle. A fraction of PSI (∼50%), not included in the supercomplexes, participates in the linear pathway. The illumination would induce a dissociation of the supercomplexes that progressively increases the fraction of PSI involved in the linear pathway.</jats:p>",

Here we study the relation of nutrient-processing capacities of the intestine and of organs beyond it (such as liver and kidneys) to each other and to natural loads of nutrients normally consumed. To control experimentally the rate of nutrient delivery to organs beyond the intestine, we administered nutrients directly into the veins of rats by the method of total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Control rats consuming the TPN solution by mouth ingested glucose at 42 mmol/day and processed it completely, as gauged by negligible appearance of glucose in urine and feces. Experimental rats receiving TPN were able to process infused glucose completely at rates up to 92 mmol/day. At higher infusion rates, they were unable to process further glucose, as gauged by rises in serum and urinary glucose levels and serum osmolality. At the highest infusion rates, they exhibited diuresis, dehydration, and both decreased weight gain and survival. These symptoms closely resemble the human diabetic condition known as nonketotic hypertonicity. Thus, a rat's body has a safety factor of 2.2 (=92/42) for glucose processing: it can process glucose at a rate 2.2 times its voluntary intake. This safety factor represents apparent excess capacity that may have evolved to process other nutrients converted into glucose, to minimize the risk of loads swamping capacities, to handle suddenly increased nutrient requirements, or to effect rapid mobilization of glucose.</jats:p>",

Using high-speed optical microscopy and taking advantage of the autofluorescence of NAD(P)H, we have observed the propagation of NAD(P)H waves within cells. When NAD(P)H waves reach the lamellipodium of morphologically polarized neutrophils, a diffusing plume of superoxide is released as evidenced by the conversion of hydroethidine in the extracellular environment to ethidium bromide. Parallel results were obtained by using high-speed emission microspectrophotometry. These experiments indicate that the spatial and temporal properties of NAD(P)H waves are transformed into ROM pulses in the extracellular environment. Propagating NAD(P)H waves allow neutrophils to specifically deliver substrate to the lamellipodium at high concentrations, thus facilitating the local and periodic release of ROMs in the direction of cell movement and/or a target.</jats:p>",

Here we propose a theoretical model in which the refolding of the partially unfolded actomyosin complex and the movement of the myosin head along the actin filament are coupled. A single ATP hydrolysis is followed by the formation of a high free-energy partially unfolded actomyosin complex, which then gradually refolds with a concomitant multiple stepping movement on the way to the lowest free-energy rigor state. The model quantitatively explains the single-molecular observation of the multiple stepping movement and is consistent with structural observations of the disorder in the actomyosin-binding process.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>\n            Lymphocyte homeostasis is the result of a critical balance between cell proliferation and death. Disruption of this subtle equilibrium can lead to the onset of leukemia, an increase in the number of lymphocytes being potentially due to both of these parameters. The relative importance of cell proliferation vs. apoptosis during pathogenesis induced by the primate T cell lymphotropic viruses and bovine leukemia virus (BLV) has been difficult to assess because of conflicting data from a range of\n            <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>\n            and\n            <jats:italic>ex vivo</jats:italic>\n            experimental systems. Here, we aim to resolve this issue by measuring the rates of cell proliferation and death in the BLV-ovine system, an animal model of human T lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1). We use a method based on the i.v. injection of 5-bromodeoxyuridine into BLV-infected sheep. We show that B lymphocytes in BLV\n            <jats:sup>+</jats:sup>\n            asymptomatic sheep proliferate significantly faster than in uninfected controls (average proliferation rate: 0.020 per day vs. 0.011 per day). In contrast, the rates of cell death were not significantly different between aleukemic BLV-infected and control sheep (average death rate 0.089 per day vs. 0.094 per day, respectively). We conclude that the increase in the number of B cells during BLV-induced lymphocytosis results from higher proliferation rates but is not due to a significant decrease in apoptosis, in contrast to data from\n            <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>\n            (\n            <jats:italic>ex vivo</jats:italic>\n            ) experiments. The imbalance created by the net increase in proliferation in the absence of compensating cell death reveals a complex mechanism of feedback regulation controlling homeostasis in the blood compartment.\n          </jats:p>",

    "title": "Alternative splicing of RGS8 gene determines inhibitory function of receptor type-specific Gq signaling",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>\n            The regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins modulate heterotrimeric G protein signaling. RGS8 is a brain-specific RGS protein of 180 aa. Here we identified a short isoform of RGS8, RGS8S, that arises by alternative splicing. RGS8S cDNA encodes a N terminus of 7 aa instead of amino acids 1–9 of RGS8 and 10–180 of RGS8. The subcellular distribution of RGS8 and RGS8S did not differ significantly in transfected cells. RGS8S accelerated, not as efficiently as RGS8, the turning on and off of Gi/o-mediated modulation of G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K\n            <jats:sup>+</jats:sup>\n            channels in\n            <jats:italic>Xenopus</jats:italic>\n            oocytes. We next examined the effects of RGS8 and RGS8S on Gq-mediated signaling. RGS8 decreased the amplitude of the response upon activation of m1 muscarinic or substance P receptors, but did not remarkably inhibit signaling from m3 muscarinic receptors. In contrast, RGS8S showed much less inhibition of the response of either of these Gq-coupled receptors. By quantitative analysis of the inhibitory effect and the protein expression level, we confirmed that the difference of inhibitory effect is caused by both the qualitative difference between RGS8 and RGS8S and the quantitative difference of the protein expression level. We also confirmed that the receptor-type specificity of inhibition is not caused by the difference of the expression level of the receptors. In summary, we showed that 9 aa in the N terminus of RGS8 contribute to the function to inhibit Gq-coupled signaling in a receptor type-specific manner and that the regulatory function of RGS8S is especially diminished on Gq-coupled responses.\n          </jats:p>",

It is assumed that the transmittance for the sensory signals is modulated by separate control circuits that sample input from the same area of the visual field but at a lower resolution. When these circuits detect significant spatial and/or temporal variations, they “open gates” for the more accurate information arising from the same area. If the variations are related to the spatial resolution, which varies within wide limits over the retina, the visual field is “opened” up to a radius where it captures the most salient structures of the image. If the temporal variations of the signals are further emphasized, the high spatial frequencies begin to dominate. If then the gaze is moved by a small amount, the transmittance of the foveal signal paths is activated strongest.</jats:p>",

We do this through the explication of ethnographic materials that detail the realization and use of Management Information (MI) in a major UK retail bank undergoing massive organizational change. We focus in particular on explicating how existing metric information was drawn upon to construct a representation of the work of the bank for those involved in managing that work. Systems designers have been increasingly interested in offering ways of conceptualizing the problem of ‘knowledge’ with a view to embedding these properties in systems. In the quest to develop representations of procedural knowledge to support work we argue that it is first necessary to understand how representations are actually created and used in work to support existing work practices.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:italic>T</jats:italic>he status of efforts to indigenize psychology in the Philippines is reviewed. We address progress in four aspects of indigenization: theoretical/conceptual, methodological, topical, and institutional. Much, but not all, of this progress is the result of efforts associated with the indigenous Sikolohiyang Pilipino (Filipino psychology) movement, which emphasizes (a) the development of a Filipino psychology that reflects the unique experiences and orientations of Filipinos, (b) Filipino identity and national consciousness, (c) explicit socio‐political considerations, (d) application of psychology to societal problems, (e) the study of less elite Filipinos, (f) interdisciplinary efforts, and (g) the use of indigenous languages in the development and dissemination of indigenous psychology. We note considerable progress, but also controversy, in the selection and interpretation of indigenous concepts and less progress in the formulation of indigenous theories. Existing theories are narrow in scope, only partially specified, and have uncertain heuristic value in generating verifiable predictions. Filipino psychologists have also adapted or further specified Western theoretical frameworks to make them more sensitive to Philippine contextual factors. Many indigenous measures have been developed, but more information is needed on their psychometric properties. Several indigenous research methods have been described and these methods typically emphasize the importance of the researcher‐participant relationship. There remain questions about the objectivity and cultural uniqueness of these methods, however, many of which involve (a) unstructured conversations and discussions in lieu of structured interviews, (b) varying degrees of participant observation, or (c) qualitative phenomenological methods. Extensive topical indigenization is evident in studies that focus on everyday Filipinos and Philippine societal concerns. Institutional indigenization is reflected in courses, theses and dissertations, journals, books, conferences, and professional organizations with an indigenous focus. Potential limitations or risks to the indigenous movement include insularity and the limited research culture. Implications of the Philippine case for indigenization efforts in other cultures are discussed.</jats:p>",

In this article, we use data from the German Socio-Economic Panel of the year 1998 to analyse the labour market performance of this group of migrants. Our key hypothesis guiding the empirical investigations is that in occupational labour markets, such as the German one, migrants are faced with specific problems when transferring their educational and vocational skills acquired in other countries. Only if they gain access to their trained occupations are they able to perform well in the labour market. Otherwise, occupational closure hinders them from receiving returns to their educational and vocational qualifications.</jats:p>",

We report here that disruption of the kifC3 gene induced fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus when cholesterol was depleted. Analysis of the reassembly process of the Golgi apparatus revealed bidirectional movement of the Golgi fragments in both wild-type and kifC3−/− cells. However, we observed a markedly reduced inwardly directed motility of the Golgi fragments in cholesterol-depleted kifC3−/− cells compared with either cholesterol-depleted wild-type cells or cholesterol-replenished kifC3−/− cells. These results suggest that (a) under the cholesterol-depleted condition, reduced inwardly directed motility of the Golgi apparatus results in the observed Golgi scattering phenotype in kifC3−/− cells, and (b) cholesterol is necessary for the Golgi fragments to attain sufficient inwardly directed motility by MT minus end–directed motors other than KIFC3, such as dynein, in kifC3−/− cells. Furthermore, we showed that Golgi scattering was much more drastic in kifC3−/− cells than in wild-type cells to the exogenous dynamitin expression even in the presence of cholesterol. These results collectively demonstrate that KIFC3 plays a complementary role in Golgi positioning and integration with cytoplasmic dynein.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Characterization of mammalian NSF (G274E) and Drosophila NSF (comatose) mutants revealed an evolutionarily conserved NSF activity distinct from ATPase-dependent SNARE disassembly that was essential for Golgi membrane fusion. Analysis of mammalian NSF function during cell-free assembly of Golgi cisternae from mitotic Golgi fragments revealed that NSF disassembles Golgi SNAREs during mitotic Golgi fragmentation. A subsequent ATPase-independent NSF activity restricted to the reassembly phase is essential for membrane fusion. NSF/α-SNAP catalyze the binding of GATE-16 to GOS-28, a Golgi v-SNARE, in a manner that requires ATP but not ATP hydrolysis. GATE-16 is essential for NSF-driven Golgi reassembly and precludes GOS-28 from binding to its cognate t-SNARE, syntaxin-5. We suggest that this occurs at the inception of Golgi reassembly to protect the v-SNARE and regulate SNARE function.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Fas and the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)1 regulate the programmed cell death of lymphocytes. The death domain kinase, receptor interacting protein (rip), is recruited to the TNFR1 upon receptor activation. In vitro, rip−/− fibroblasts are sensitive to TNF-induced cell death due to an impaired nuclear factor κB response. Because rip−/− mice die at birth, we were unable to examine the effects of a targeted rip mutation on lymphocyte survival. To address the contribution of RIP to immune homeostasis, we examined lethally irradiated mice reconstituted with rip−/− hematopoietic precursors. We observed a decrease in rip−/− thymocytes and T cells in both wild-type C57BL/6 and recombination activating gene 1−/− irradiated hosts. In contrast, the B cell and myeloid lineages are unaffected by the absence of rip. Thus, the death domain kinase rip is required for T cell development. Unlike Fas-associated death domain, rip does not regulate T cell proliferation, as rip−/− T cells respond to polyclonal activators. However, rip-deficient mice contain few viable CD4+ and CD8+ thymocytes, and rip−/− thymocytes are sensitive to TNF-induced cell death. Surprisingly, the rip-associated thymocyte apoptosis was not rescued by the absence of TNFR1, but appears to be rescued by an absence of TNFR2. Taken together, this study implicates RIP and TNFR2 in thymocyte survival.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Accumulating evidence has shown the importance of Stat6-mediated signaling in allergic diseases. In this study, we show a novel regulatory mechanism of Stat6-mediated signaling in mast cells. When Stat6 is activated by interleukin (IL)-4 and translocated to the nucleus, Stat6 is cleaved by a nucleus-associated protease in mast cells. The cleaved 65-kD Stat6 lacks the COOH-terminal transactivation domain and functions as a dominant-negative molecule to Stat6-mediated transcription. The retrovirus-mediated expression of cleavage-resistant Stat6 mutants prolongs the nuclear accumulation of Stat6 upon IL-4 stimulation and enhances IL-4–induced gene expression and growth inhibition in mast cells. These results indicate that the proteolytic processing of Stat6 functions as a lineage-specific negative regulator of Stat6-dependent signaling in mast cells, and thus suggest that it may account for the limited role of Stat6 in IL-4 signaling in mast cells.</jats:p>",

Both IFN-γ and pfp were critical for suppression of lymphomagenesis, however the level of protection afforded by IFN-γ was strain specific. Lymphomas arising in IFN-γ-deficient mice were very nonimmunogenic compared with those derived from pfp-deficient mice, suggesting a comparatively weaker immunoselection pressure by IFN-γ. Single loss of IL-12, IL-18, or TNF was not sufficient for spontaneous tumor development. A significant incidence of late onset adenocarcinoma observed in both IFN-γ– and pfp-deficient mice indicated that some epithelial tissues were also subject to immunosurveillance.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Unmethylated CpG motifs present in bacterial DNA stimulate a strong innate immune response. There is evidence that DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) mediates CpG signaling. Specifically, wortmannin (an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase [PI3]-kinases including DNA-PK) interferes with CpG-dependent cell activation, and DNA-PK knockout (KO) mice fail to respond to CpG stimulation. Current studies establish that wortmannin actually inhibits the uptake and colocalization of CpG DNA with toll-like receptor (TLR)-9 in endocytic vesicles, thereby preventing CpG-induced activation of the NF-κB signaling cascade. We find that DNA-PK is not involved in this process, since three strains of DNA-PK KO mice responded normally to CpG DNA. These results support a model in which CpG signaling is mediated through TLR-9 but not DNA-PK, and suggest that wortmannin-sensitive member(s) of the PI3-kinase family play a critical role in shuttling CpG DNA to TLR-9.</jats:p>",

Some P2X channels display a time- and activation-dependent change in permeability as they undergo the transition from the relatively Na+-selective I1 state to the I2 state, which is also permeable to organic cations. We report that the previously reported permeability change of rat P2X2 (rP2X2) channels does not occur at mouse P2X2 (mP2X2) channels expressed in oocytes. Domain swaps, species chimeras, and point mutations were employed to determine that two specific amino acid residues in the cytosolic tail domain govern this difference in behavior between the two orthologous channels. The change in pore diameter was characterized using reversal potential measurements and excluded field theory for several organic ions; both rP2X2 and mP2X2 channels have a pore diameter of ∼11 Å in the I1 state, but the transition to the I2 state increases the rP2X2 diameter by at least 3 Å. The I1 to I2 transition occurs with a rate constant of ∼0.5 s−1. The data focus attention on specific residues of P2X2 channel cytoplasmic domains as determinants of permeation in a state-specific manner.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Inward rectification in strong inward rectifiers such as Kir2.1 is attributed to voltage-dependent block by intracellular polyamines and Mg2+. Block by the polyamine spermine has a complex voltage dependence with shallow and steep components and complex concentration dependence. To understand the mechanism, we measured macroscopic Kir2.1 currents in excised inside-out giant patches from Xenopus oocytes expressing Kir2.1, and single channel currents in the inside-out patches from COS7 cells transfected with Kir2.1. We found that as spermine concentration or voltage increased, the shallow voltage-dependent component of spermine block at more negative voltages was caused by progressive reduction in the single channel current amplitude, without a decrease in open probability. We attributed this effect to spermine screening negative surface charges involving E224 and E299 near the inner vestibule of the channel, thereby reducing K ion permeation rate. This idea was further supported by experiments in which increasing ionic strength also decreased Kir2.1 single channel amplitude, and by mutagenesis experiments showing that this component of spermine block decreased when E224 and E299, but not D172, were neutralized. The steep voltage-dependent component of block at more depolarized voltages was attributed to spermine migrating deeper into the pore and causing fast open channel block. A quantitative model incorporating both features showed excellent agreement with the steady-state and kinetic data. In addition, this model accounts for previously described substate behavior induced by a variety of Kir2.1 channel blockers.</jats:p>",

The present study investigates the physical association of β1-integrins and Kv1.3 voltage-gated potassium channels in melanoma cell membranes using resonance energy transfer (RET) techniques. RET between donor-labeled anti–β1-integrin and acceptor-labeled anti-Kv1.3 channels was detected on LOX cells adherent to glass and fibronectin-coated coverslips. However, RET was not observed on LOX cells in suspension, indicating that molecular proximity of these membrane molecules is adherence-related. Several K+ channel blockers, including tetraethylammonium, 4-aminopyridine, and verapamil, inhibited RET between β1-integrins and Kv1.3 channels. However, the irrelevant K+ channel blocker apamin had no effect on RET between β1-integrins and Kv1.3 channels. Based on these findings, we speculate that the lateral association of Kv1.3 channels with β1-integrins contributes to the regulation of integrin function and that channel blockers might affect tumor cell behavior by influencing the assembly of supramolecular structures containing integrins.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Dependence of Radiation-induced Transcription Factor Activation in Human Breast Carcinoma Cells",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Ionizing radiation (1–5 Gy) activates the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a major effector of the p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. MAPK and its downstream effector, p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK), phosphorylate transcription factors involved in cell proliferation. To establish the role of the EGFR/MAPK pathway in radiation-induced transcription factor activation, MDA-MB-231 human breast carcinoma cells were examined using specific inhibitors of signaling pathways. Gel-shift analysis revealed three different profile groups: 1) transcription factors that responded to both radiation (2 Gy) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) (CREB, Egr, Ets, and Stat3); 2) factors that responded to radiation, but not EGF (C/EBP and Stat1); and 3) those that did not respond significantly to either radiation or EGF (AP-1 and Myc). Within groups 1 and 2, a two- to fivefold maximum stimulation of binding activity was observed at 30–60 min after irradiation. Interestingly, only transcription factors that responded to EGF had radiation responses significantly inhibited by the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, AG1478; these responses were also abrogated by farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI) or PD98059, inhibitors of Ras and MEK1/2, respectively. Moreover, radiation-induced increases in CREB and p90RSK phosphorylation and activation of Stat3 and Egr-1 reporter constructs by radiation were all abolished by AG1478. These data demonstrate a distinct radiation response profile at the transcriptional level that is dependent on enhanced EGFR/Ras/MAPK signaling.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>To investigate the importance of tyrosine recognition by the AP-1B clathrin adaptor subunit μ1B for basolateral sorting of integral membrane proteins in polarized epithelial cells, we have produced and characterized a mutant form of μ1B. The mutant (M-μ1B) contains alanine substitutions of each of the four conserved residues, which in the AP-2 adaptor subunit μ2 are critical for interacting with tyrosine-based endocytosis signals. We show M-μ1B is defective for tyrosine binding in vitro, but is nevertheless incorporated into AP-1 complexes in transfected cells. Using LLC-PK1 cells expressing either wild type or M-μ1B, we find that there is inefficient basolateral expression of membrane proteins whose basolateral targeting signals share critical tyrosines with signals for endocytosis. In contrast, membrane proteins whose basolateral targeting signals are distinct from their endocytosis signals (transferrin and low-density lipoprotein receptors) accumulate at the basolateral domain normally, although in a manner that is strictly dependent on μ1B or M-μ1B expression. Our results suggest that μ1B interacts with different classes of basolateral targeting signals in distinct ways.</jats:p>",

It is found that the ligand bound introduces in general small structural perturbations at the binding site of the protein. However, such small structural changes can lead to important alterations in the recognition pattern of the protein. The impact of these findings in docking procedures is discussed.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Contact: modesto@luz.bq.ub.es; javier@far1.far.ub.es</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>* To whom correspondence should be addressed.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Motivation: The last few years have seen the development of DNA microarray technology that allows simultaneous measurement of the expression levels of thousands of genes. While many methods have been developed to analyze such data, most have been visualization-based. Methods that yield quantitative conclusions have been diverse and complex.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Results: We present two straightforward methods for identifying specific genes whose expression is linked with a phenotype or outcome variable as well as for systematically predicting sample class membership: (1) a conservative, permutation-based approach to identifying differentially expressed genes; (2) an augmentation of K-nearest-neighbor pattern classification. Our analyses replicate the quantitative conclusions of Golub et al. (1999; Science, 286, 531–537) on leukemia data, with better classification results, using far simpler methods. With the breast tumor data of Perou et al. (2000; Nature, 406, 747–752), the methods lend rigorous quantitative support to the conclusions of the original paper. In the case of the lymphoma data in Alizadeh et al. (2000; Nature, 403, 503–511), our analyses only partially support the conclusions of the original authors.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Availability: The software and supplementary information are available freely to researchers at academic and non-profit institutions at http://cc.ucsf.edu/jain/public</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Contact: ajain@cc.ucsf.edu</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>* To whom correspondence should be addressed.</jats:p>",

To explain why, the author presents and analyzes the technical literature. The author compares the forecasts with actual results and then develops a simple model to extrapolate and replicate the prE‐1992 Portuguese experiences. This model builds on relatively rapid growth already under way. The author holds that relative export industry market share as a function of relative sales effort explained export performance. Further, the author argues that four country industry concentration ratios as a function of changes in revealed comparative advantage as well as “home market” institutions explain the competitive situations faced by Portuguese exports both before and after 1992. The concatenation of these four variables yields successive equilibria.</jats:p>",

The results indicate that LMPs have had significant effects on outflows from short‐term unemployment. There is a net positive effect from LMP commencements on short‐term unemployed female outflow rates. However, females experienced negative spillover effects from male LMP commencements. These spillover effects appear to be associated with wage subsidy programs and suggest the net impact of such programs may have been overstated in previous studies.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Inhibition of amyloid β‐peptide (Aβ) production by blocking γ‐secretase activity is at present one of the most promising therapeutic strategies to slow progression of Alzheimer's disease pathology. γ‐secretase inhibitors apparently block Aβ generation via interference with presenilin (PS) function. Besides being an essential component of the γ‐secretase complex, PS itself may be an aspartyl protease with γ‐secretase activity, which is not only required for Aβ production but also for a similar proteolytic process involved in Notch signaling. Here we demonstrate that treatment of zebrafish embryos with a known γ‐secretase inhibitor affects embryonic development in a manner indistinguishable from Notch signaling deficiencies at morphological, molecular and biochemical levels. This indicates severe side‐effects of γ‐secretase inhibitors in any Notch‐dependent cell fate decision and demonstrates that the zebrafish is an ideal vertebrate system to validate compounds that selectively affect Aβ production, but not Notch signaling, under <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic> conditions.</jats:p>",

The model has its origins in the work of Moffitt and shares features with standard statistical methods for ecological inference. We outline the methodological framework proposed by Moffitt and present several extensions of the model to increase its potential application in a wider array of research contexts. We also discuss the relationship with previous lines of related research in political science. The example illustration uses survey data on American presidential vote intentions from a five-wave panel study conducted by Patterson in 1976. We treat the panel data as independent cross sections and compare the estimates of the Markov model with both dynamic panel parameter estimates and the actual observations in the panel. The results suggest that the proposed model provides a useful framework for the analysis of transitions in repeated cross sections. Open problems requiring further study are discussed.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>\n            All organisms examined to date, respond to a sudden change in environmental temperature with a specific cascade of adaptation reactions that, in some cases, have been identified and monitored at the molecular level. According to the type of temperature change, this response has been termed heat shock response (HSR) or cold shock response (CSR). During the HSR, a specialized sigma factor has been shown to play a central regulatory role in controlling expression of genes predominantly required to cope with heat-induced alteration of protein conformation. In contrast, after cold shock, nucleic acid structure and proteins interacting with the biological information molecules DNA and RNA appear to play a major cellular role. Currently, no cold–specific sigma factor has been identified. Therefore, unlike the HSR, the CSR appears to be organized as a complex stimulon rather than resembling a regulon. This review has been designed to draw a refined picture of our current understanding of the CSR in\n            <jats:italic>Bacillus subtilis</jats:italic>\n            . Important processes such as temperature sensing, membrane adaptation, modification of the translation apparatus, as well as nucleoid reorganization and some metabolic aspects, are discussed in brief. Special emphasis is placed on recent findings concerning the nucleic acid binding cold shock proteins, which play a fundamental role, not only during cold shock adaptation but also under optimal growth conditions.\n          </jats:p>",

Here we employed immobilized template assays to correlate transcriptional activation with mediator and TFIID recruitment. In reactions reconstituted with purified proteins, we found that activator, TFIID, and mediator engage in reciprocal cooperative interactions to form a complex on promoter DNA. Preassembly of the coactivator complex accelerates the rate of transcription in a cell-free system depleted of TFIID and mediator. Our data argue that this coactivator complex is an intermediate in the assembly of an active transcription complex. Furthermore, the reciprocity of the interactions demonstrates that the complex could in principle be nucleated with either TFIID or mediator, implying that alternative pathways could be utilized to generate diversity in the way activators function in vivo.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Prior work has indicated that D-type cyclin–cdk4 complexes, which are only active in proliferating cells, can suppress the skeletal muscle differentiation program in proliferating myoblasts. In this study, we show that cyclin D–cdk activity can block the activity of the MEF2 family of transcriptional regulators, which are crucial regulators of skeletal muscle gene expression. We have found that cyclin D–cdk activity blocks the association of MEF2C with the coactivator protein GRIP-1 and thereby inhibits the activity of MEF2. During skeletal muscle differentiation, GRIP-1 is localized to punctate nuclear structures and can apparently tether MEF2 to such structures. Cotransfection of GRIP-1 can both potentiate the transcriptional activity of a Gal4–MEF2C construct and induce MEF2C localization to punctate nuclear structures. Consistent with the absence of punctate nuclear GRIP-1 in proliferating myoblasts, we have found that ectopic cyclin D–cdk4 expression disrupts the localization of both GRIP-1 and MEF2C to these punctate subnuclear structures. Our findings indicate that cyclin D–cdk4 activity represses skeletal muscle differentiation in proliferating cells by blocking the association of MEF2 with the coactivator GRIP-1 and concomitantly disrupts the association of these factors with punctate nuclear subdomains within the cell.</jats:p>",

Here, we describe the developmental pathway of MGU assembly in Arabidopsis and report two classes of mutations that affect the integrity and/or the positioning of the MGU in the mature pollen grain. In germ unit malformed (gum) mutants, the vegetative nucleus is positioned adjacent to the pollen grain wall, separate from the two sperm cells, whereas in MGU displaced (mud) mutants, the intact MGU is displaced to the pollen grain wall.mud and gum mutants correspond to male-specific gametophytic mutations that also reduce pollen fitness. Genetic mapping showed that the gum1 andgum2 mutations are genetically linked, possibly allelic, whereas the mud1 and mud2 mutations correspond to two unlinked loci mapping on different chromosomes. The hierarchical relationship between mud andgum mutations was investigated by phenotypic analysis of double mutants. gum1 appeared to act earlier thanmud1 and mud2, affecting initial MGU assembly and its stability during pollen maturation. In contrast,mud1 and mud2 mutations appear to act only on MGU positioning during final maturation. From in planta analyses of pollen germination in mud andgum mutants, we conclude that the initial proximity and positioning of MGU components is not required for their entrance into the pollen tube, but the efficiency of MGU translocation is reduced.</jats:p>",

These novel calcium sensors are likely to be crucial mediators of responses to diverse endogenous and environmental cues. However, the precise biological function(s) of most CDPKs remains elusive. The Arabidopsis genome is predicted to encode 34 different CDPKs. In this Update, we analyze the Arabidopsis CDPK gene family and review the expression, regulation, and possible functions of plant CDPKs. By combining emerging cellular and genomic technologies with genetic and biochemical approaches, the characterization of Arabidopsis CDPKs provides a valuable opportunity to understand the plant calcium-signaling network.</jats:p>",

For many situations, this may be the preferred method of induction because it avoids direct application of comparatively high concentrations of an ethanol solution. Although induction was seen with less than 0.4 μm ethanol vapor, maximal induction of the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene was achieved after 48 h in leaves of tobacco plants enclosed with 4.5 μm ethanol vapor. In the absence of ethanol, there is no detectable gene expression. Treatment of potato tubers with ethanol vapor results in uniform β-glucoronidase (GUS) expression. Vapor treatment of a single oilseed rape leaf resulted in induction of GUS in the treated leaf only and 14C-ethanol labeling in tobacco confirmed that the inducer was not translocated. In contrast, enclosure of the roots, aerial parts, or whole plant with ethanol vapor resulted in induction of GUS activity in leaves and roots. The data reported here broaden the utility of the alc system for research and crop biotechnology.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Effect of Yeast <i>CTA1</i> Gene Expression on Response of Tobacco Plants to Tobacco Mosaic Virus Infection",
    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The response of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv Xanthi-nc) plants with elevated catalase activity was studied after infection by tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). These plants contain the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) peroxisomal catalase geneCTA1 under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. The transgenic lines exhibited 2- to 4-fold higher total in vitro catalase activity than untransformed control plants under normal growth conditions. Cellular localization of the CTA1 protein was established using immunocytochemical analysis. Gold particles were detected mainly inside peroxisomes, whereas no significant labeling was detected in other cellular compartments or in the intercellular space. The physiological state of the transgenic plants was evaluated in respect to growth rate, general appearance, carbohydrate content, and dry weight. No significant differences were recorded in comparison with non-transgenic tobacco plants. The 3,3′-diaminobenzidine-stain method was applied to visualize hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the TMV infected tissue. Presence of H2O2 could be detected around necrotic lesions caused by TMV infection in non-transgenic plants but to a much lesser extent in the CTA1 transgenic plants. In addition, the size of necrotic lesions was significantly bigger in the infected leaves of the transgenic plants. Changes in the distribution of H2O2 and in lesion formation were not reflected by changes in salicylic acid production. In contrast to the local response, the systemic response in upper noninoculated leaves of both CTA1 transgenic and control plants was similar. This suggests that increased cellular catalase activity influences local but not systemic response to TMV infection.</jats:p>",

Through dye-labeling experiments in untransformed onion epidermal and tobacco culture cells and through the expression of green fluorescent protein targeted to either the nucleus or the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum/nuclear envelope in these cells, we have visualized deep grooves and invaginations into the large nuclei of these cells. In onion, these structures, which are similar to invaginations seen in some animal cells, form tubular or planelike infoldings of the nuclear envelope. Both grooves and invaginations are stable structures, and both have cytoplasmic cores containing actin bundles that can support cytoplasmic streaming. In dividing tobacco cells, invaginations seem to form during cell division, possibly from strands of the endoplasmic reticulum trapped in the reforming nucleus. The substantial increase in nuclear surface area resulting from these grooves and invaginations, their apparent preference for association with nucleoli, and the presence in them of actin bundles that support vesicle motility suggest that the structures might function both in mRNA export from the nucleus and in protein import from the cytoplasm to the nucleus.</jats:p>",

In an effort to gain an understanding about ethics in an EU country where little previous research has been conducted, this article is directed toward the attitudes of future Greek professionals. A sample of the current college‐student population in Greece was surveyed regarding professional and business ethics to understand how we might expect individuals from Greece to behave once they have to make the difficult decisions that are necessary in business circumstances.</jats:p>",

However, there was no set pattern or correlation that identified relatively high IS investment with high growth or vice versa. The future forecast for IS investment favours a modest increase in the one to three years planning horizon. Although, given that these are high‐growth companies growing at rates in excess of 15 per cent per annum, the modest increase could represent a real reduction unless the price of technology reduces at a significant rate. The most notable evaluation criteria were “to facilitate change” and “formal financial investment”, but these were closely followed by “act of faith” or “gut feel” approaches. When asked to identify preferred project options, in the past the clear choice of most was medium risk and medium pay off. In the future the preferred options support medium risk and high  pay off. </jats:p>",

The surviving records are used to construct a picture of a complex and sophisticated information system, which not only used accounting records to control managers but also used the same managers as sources of information about the broader context. The apparent success of this system is set against the reluctance of other brewers to adopt it. This is seen to relate in part to the very complexity of the information system created, but also in part to the broader perceptions of brewers about the nature and status of their trade.</jats:p>",

In doing so it considers both the local inhabitants and new age travellers who are involved in such protest to show that not only does ecoprotest, as a form of protest, raise the profile of environmental issues within public discourse but also opens up space for such discourse. Of greater significance is the effect which the ecoprotest, movement has upon a local sense of identity and community. Indeed the travellers themselves, through their action and engagement, demonstrate that the key determinant of community identity is grounded in self‐belief and shared aspirations rather than in an externally imposed definition or in any economic imperatives. This paper shows that the migration of this sense of self‐belief into mainstream society serves to demonstrate that community spirit and identity are extant in modern society but need a catalyst for their re‐emergence. In doing so the role of ecoprotest points towards a possible mechanism for the re‐emergence of an active and participatory sense of community identity within society as a whole.</jats:p>",

Adds that political risk insurance is available from agencies such as the World Bank’s MIGA or the US government’s OPIC, but projecting needs for such insurance has not been a consistent practice. Reveals that business publications, such as <jats:italic>The Economist</jats:italic>, and firms such as Business Environment Risk Intelligence, Inc. (BERI), provide regular projections of political risk based on a variety of observed political and social variables. Examines choice of these variables in an Asian context and assesses statistically the forecasting capability of <jats:italic>The Economist </jats:italic>and BERI models. Finds that the existence of underlying theory makes a positive difference in the ability of the models to forecast correctly and to provide useful advice to foreign investors. Indicates that both models include variables representing conditions that clearly indicate future trouble for investors. Shows that, with some revisions, existing models of political risk can be useful in guiding investment and trade.</jats:p>",

These operating units are seen as offering the flexibility and responsiveness necessary in today’s turbulent and fast‐changing industrial situations. This article reviews the particular demands of these new organizational structures, including the reconciling of latest thinking on control and co‐ordination needs with the advantages of unit autonomy. It then offers a vision and structure for an information technology‐based integrating framework. The system is styled a virtual neural business system (V‐NBS) to suggest that it would not only manage and and fuel the operations of the network partners by linking their sensory and motor components, but also act as a whole‐system knowledge, experience and “thinking function accessible and available to support all managers in their individual decision making”.</jats:p>",

Indeed, if no such changes occur it may prove difficult to justify the introduction of these technologies. Particularly, one might expect that the locations in which people perform their daily tasks should be impacted to some degree by improved communication facilities. A recent diary study of managerial work in UK organisations, conducted by the authors, suggests that the locational patterns of managers in the work‐place appear not to have changed significantly, if at all, over the past 30 years, despite the rapid technological changes that have taken place during that era. Additionally, the use of the conventional telephone has remained constant during that period despite technological improvements and the introduction of alternative technologies such as fax, electronic mail, cellular phones, messaging services and video‐conferencing. These findings suggest that the communication habits of managers are not significantly influenced by the introduction of new technologies, but rather that their work patterns are probably set by more complex factors that may be organisational, psychological or sociological in nature.</jats:p>",

Professionals often seek out their workplace within an organisation but then proceed to act as soloists, which makes fragmentation, mediocrity and non‐commitment the rule rather than the exception. The manager’s reflex dictates that he/she tackles problems with control and command, resulting in all sorts of conflicts. It is argued that this dysfunctional habit can be corrected by introducing a clear division of roles: professionals manage the primary process, managers the secondary processes. Peace then will be restored but fragmentation, mediocrity and non‐commitment are still evident. We have found heuristically that these core problems only can disappear when professionals and managers tackle them in a concerted action by developing a collective ambition, investing in mutual learning and setting performance standards. Although professionals’ loner genes hold them back in concerted action on these matters, they can overcome this resistance when managers are willing and able to orchestrate a dialogue on these matters. This is a tall order, but the core problems can thus be transformed into inspiration, growth and dedication.</jats:p>",

Only one minimal friction coefficient value at 340–355 °C (μ = 0.065) was observed in the absence of MoDTC. Chemical characterization of worn tracks of the cylinder bore using reflected FTIR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and ESCA, indicated that both the base stock and the tribological additives, ZDTP and MoDTC, experienced tribochemical reactions yielding MoO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>, MoS<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and carbonaceous species as temperature ramped up stepwise.

Uses material gathered in the survey to consider the role of trade union training in health and safety and its contribution to the operation of participative management of health and safety at the workplace level. Discusses the significance of employee representation in health and safety regulation and examines the support provided by trade union training in the context of factors that influence its effectiveness. Several specific aspects of trade union training are identified as characteristic. Other aspects of trade union health and safety education that contribute to the overall support and proactive role of trade unions in preventative health and safety are identified and discussed. Trade unions make extensive provision for education and training in occupational health and safety. This is a significant factor in raising awareness of health and safety issues and the development of a preventive health and safety ethos in all of the countries included in the study. Argues that it is possible to identify a common pedagogy in trade union education and training in occupational health and safety. This pedagogy is rooted in the educational methods of labour education, emphasizing the value of participants’ own experience and developing a collective approach to the definition and solution of problems, while encouraging listening and communication skills in this process. Shows that although trade unions have suffered a loss of influence and power across Europe during the past decade ‐ and in some countries their losses have been severe ‐ in the case of education and training in health and safety, generally trade unions have maintained a significant provision as well as continuing to develop an innovative and dynamic approach to its content and delivery.</jats:p>",

As a result, and also given the limited available comparative studies into the issue, it would be unwise to suggest an Islamic HRM model.

Despite recent attempts by the European Union to bring to the fore the issue of working time, it has a rather long pedigree in labour management literature. The main arguments dictating the direction of change in working time arrangements are associated with discretion/choice debates, labour force changes, equality issues, technology and organiza‐tional efficiency and the unemployment/work‐sharing argument. Focuses specifically on one workforce variable, namely part‐time work. Believes that the classification of the labour market into the core (typical) and periphery (atypical), in the context of labour flexibility, is far too simplistic.

The conclusion is that money purchase schemes fail to meet employees’ needs, in particular at a time when the security and level of state pensions is being progressively eroded. An alternative defined benefit structure is proposed, that is, the revalued career average pension scheme. It is argued that this benefit structure can be made attractive to both employers and employees, as it addresses many of the problems associated with final salary schemes and provides pension scheme members with the security they value.</jats:p>",

Of the sample organisations, 85 per cent considered investment in MTD to be linked to business success and 80 per cent of organisations engaged in some form of MTD.

Examines the opportunities of information technology (IT) in improving access, transfer and use of agricultural information in the rural areas of Kenya. This paper has used the term “information technology” to include CD‐ROM, computer networks, desktop publishing, interactive video, packet radio, expert systems, geographical information systems and satellite communications. The methodology adopted by the study was the use of case studies of the organisations and institutions that use IT in disseminating agricultural information to the rural population in Kenya. The study was limited to agricultural information. The information technologies examined include CD‐ROM, computer networks, video and desktop publishing. Highlights the advantages and limitations of IT in disseminating information in the rural areas of Kenya. Among the factors that make IT relevant for rural development are vast storage, fast and inexpensive communication channels, links between different media, easy and enjoyable use at comparatively and steadily declining costs. Concludes that for IT to have more impact on rural development, it should be needs driven, rather than technology driven. This can only be achieved if the needs of the users are placed at the centre and appropriate technologies adopted.</jats:p>",

The growth and persistence of unemployment may be the result of the deregulation of global financial markets in the 1970s that has been followed by huge growth in short‐term capital flows. These flows have produced a significant increase in risk aversion in public sector and private sectors.

Further, the Turks began to enter the growing commerce and transportation industries in the early transition. Shifts in the wage structure, however, favored the ethnic Bulgarians, and these changes outweighed ethnic Turk gains in the measured characteristics. In addition to these shifts, an increase in the overall level of inequality in the labor market punished those at the low‐end of the wage distribution, exacerbating the existing ethnic earnings differential.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper analyses the effects of both training and overeducation on upward mobility in the internal labour market, the professional market and the “supplementary labour market”. The latter segment can be considered as a broadly defined secondary labour market as it is not restricted to the low‐level unskilled jobs only. This broader definition – also found in initial segmentation theory – allows for the changed character of the secondary labour market in the industrialized countries. As expected, “career training” influences upward mobility positively. However, contrary to the predictions of segmentation theory, particularly in the supplementary labour market career training is a means of gaining promotion to a higher level job. Overeducation also affects upward mobility positively, which indicates that overeducation is to some extent a temporary phenomenon at the individual level. However, this also holds in particular in the supplementary segment of the labour market. The estimation results show that the supplementary labour market is less of a dead end than the segmentation theory predicts and is a more valuable place to get training than has been recognized. The supplementary market probably plays an important role in the transition process between initial education and the labour market. Although workers may be initially overeducated in their first jobs, a supplementary segment job could be an attractive step towards reaching a more suitable position in the labour market.</jats:p>",

Furthermore, the decisions related to MTD activity are still dependent on personal relations, family ties, tribalism, etc. rather than on an established procedure. Focuses on the assessment of MTD needs and selection for MTDPs in Libyan industrial companies by finding out how these companies select their employees for MTDPs and the main ways and techniques used by the companies to perform this activity. Reveals that the approaches and techniques used by companies for selecting their employees for MTDPs and for assessing MTD needs depend mostly on indications of performance reports and on bosses’ and supervisors’ views.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In the post‐Second World War period, working and social life has been organised around the concept of a standard day and week with premium payments for work undertaken during unsocial hours. In recent years, this standard model for organising working‐time has been placed under pressure from a range of supply‐ and demand‐side factors. Greater female and student participation in the labour force has led to a fragmentation of working‐time preferences on the supply side. Employers, on the demand side, have also sought to dismember the standard working‐time model to eliminate premium payments for unsocial work and to achieve greater control and flexibility in the allocation of non‐standard working hours. Employer demand for this type of labour flexibility has been one of the central rationales for the decentralisation of industrial relations systems in Australia and New Zealand. This paper seeks to assess whether employers in the more deregulated New Zealand system have instigated a vastly different non‐standard working‐time regime from their Australian counterparts. The article concludes that there are only minor differences in the distribution of non‐standard working hours in Australia and New Zealand. This finding challenges the notion that the arbitration system is a major impediment to the organisation of working‐time. Rather, it appears that production and operational demands are the central imperative in the structuring of working‐time within firms.</jats:p>",

One serious problem with the SAKE data is that about 17 per cent of employed individuals did not report wages. Those studies which use the SAKE data to estimate wage functions simply ignore these non‐respondents. Such an approach could lead to a serious selectivity bias if the response decision is not purely random. In this study this issue is analysed in a double‐selectivity framework, in which both this response decision and the usual market‐participation decision are modelled. Although the response decision can be partially explained by certain socio‐economic variables, a large degree of randomness/unexplained variation exists. The authors therefore conclude that, in the absence of a better model, the standard approach at estimating wage functions (i.e. only correcting for the selectivity bias arising from women’s participation decision) is the most appropriate one.</jats:p>",

Structural equation analysis suggested that productivity and people maintenance values affect goal interdependence which in turn results in leader effectiveness and employee commitment.

Results also suggest that leader values may directly induce employee commitment. The study’s findings and previous research were interpreted as suggesting that productivity and people values coupled with cooperative goals provide a foundation for effective leadership.</jats:p>",

And, beyond these individual process attributes, there are claims, or at least predictions, of synergistic benefits in the form of improved energy absorption and fatigue life for demanding applications.

This work aims at contributing to the understanding of how the effectiveness of performance feedback information can be improved by defining a set of distinct performance feedback dimensions based on a PMS literature review, and by validating it empirically on an international sample of 164 manufacturing organisations. The proposed dimensions are: relevance as performance feedback orientation to the achievement of objectives; dynamic adjustment of performance feedback; relevance as usefulness of cost performance feedback; relevance as usefulness of non‐cost performance feedback; timeliness of shop‐floor performance feedback; personal performance feedback; and feedback on the overall process performances. The analysis shows that these dimensions are distinct, thus allowing to deal with them separately both in PMS design and audit. As far as the effectiveness of the performance feedback is concerned, it emerges that for several dimensions higher scores are associated to higher operating performances (cost, time and quality), but in one case this only holds for managers and in another one only for supervisors.</jats:p>",

A more modern approach has been advised by the TOPP program. TOPP measures performance along three dimensions: efficiency, effectiveness and adaptability. TOPP uses questionnaires to collect data. Another approach is applied in the EU ENAPS project where the goal is to build a European benchmarking database. ENAPS provides a set of tools to a number of agents actually doing the benchmarks. Performance measurement requires an enterprise model. The EU FOF project developed such a model. This was further developed by TOPP and then further refined in ENAPS.</jats:p>",

Downsizing must be based on a thorough analysis of the firm’s prioritized opportunities and their limited economic resources to achieve them. Some operations research techniques have appeared in the literature as practical aids in downsizing methodology. The purpose and significance of the research in this paper is to: provide the first demonstration of how a prioritized multi‐objective programming‐oriented methodology (i.e. goal programming) can be used for planning the downsizing of production/operations resources; and demonstrate a new methodological approach that can be used to determine previously hidden goals in a manufacturing linear programming model of the downsizing problem. Based on a problem reported in the literature, this paper will illustrate how an optimal allocation of production resources can be achieved while providing useful information in which to ensure other prioritized goals and their economic tradeoffs are considered in the downsizing analysis.</jats:p>",

To provide better assessment of the performance of nominal income targeting in practice, this paper focuses on Germany where this policy is implemented. The results highlight the importance of price stability in the design of German monetary policy. Furthermore, causality test results indicate a causal flow from money to nominal income.  However, there is no evidence of a causal flow from nominal income to various definitions of money. These results confirm the Bundesbank’s claim that monetary growth runs ahead of fluctuations in nominal income in Germany. That is, the Bundesbank is able to target nominal income by using a monetary aggregate. These findings challenge the skepticism regarding the use of a monetary aggregate as the intermediate target, which has arisen mainly from the US experience.</jats:p>",

When a panel estimator is properly used, our econometric evidence confirms our hypothesis. Evidence from a Parks regression technique suggests that total rent‐seeking is positively related to the amount of federal spending, as others have shown, but that rent‐seeking efforts increase when federal budget deficits are reduced, threatening existing spending patterns and rents.

The LRDD collected all the records related to the engineering project and to various aspects of people’s lives during that time, including tax records, plats, maps, catalogs, field reports, etc., and asked Southeast Missouri State University’s Kent Library to house them. Because of space considerations, the collection has been placed at the Bootheel Center, in Malden, Missouri. This article gives a brief history of Southeast Missouri and the LRDD, describes the collection, and highlights why these papers are of fundamental importance to the citizens of Southeast Missouri.</jats:p>",

Six center‐locating algorithms are described, which are central to the developed approach. These algorithms are able to achieve sub‐pixel accuracy. The center of mass algorithm that uses three points, gives the best repeatability over the other algorithms.

This article explores the theoretical implications of these complex relationships, as the locus of an individual’s use of time moves along the axes of engagement/disengagement from organization and task. The author urges organizational theorists to explore and evaluate the importance of understanding time usage for a better understanding of phenomena such as organizational learning, creativity, and quality of work life. This model provides a framework for further investigation and theoretical understanding of time from the perspective of the individual as well as of the organization.</jats:p>",

Describes how the programme has been running since 1983, evolving from that time, to take cognizance of: major changes in the profiles of unemployed managers; changes in the industrial structure of Northern Ireland; and paradigmatic shifts within the field of management development. Concludes, from evaluation, that both groups have benefited significantly from the programme, noting that it has aided many SMEs to overcome some of the major obstacles to growth, efficiency and competitiveness, while concurrently raising the confidence level of the unemployed manager, developing his/her competences and increasing future employment prospects. Considers that the programme model will prove beneficial to other training providers and support agencies that are considering link programmes as part of their management development provision.</jats:p>",

Argues that a kind of management development in action is required to help managers address the defensive routines in the organization or articulate and disseminate workable solutions they find in the midst of practice. This kind of management development helps practitioners to interpenetrate each others’ theories of practice and goes beyond the traditional stance of many organization and management developers to focus on “process”. Management development in action requires an integration of “process” and “content” and reframes the debate between these two positions by proposing an inquiring and designing stance towards causal reasoning in action.</jats:p>",

Behavioural aspects reveal the powerful role of distributors/agents and wholesalers in the distribution scene, as well as signs of channel conflict and competition. Overall, the study demonstrates that the Saudi distribution system is unique, complex and transient, and one where traditional and modern elements coexist.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Marketing theorists and practitioners have for many years extolled the need for and the value of developing a concept which has become known as a “market orientation”. Indeed, since the early 1950s a variety of researchers have argued that a market orientation is frequently associated with high levels of performance. However, despite the widespread acceptance of the merits of a market orientation, researchers have found comparatively low levels of adoption within British industry. The relatively limited extent of market orientation development is possibly explained through the findings of a number of studies which conclude that a wide range of organizational barriers impede market orientation. However, this paper argues that extant research into the barriers to market orientation is frequently restricted by the explicit concentration on management‐level barriers to the detriment of shopfloor‐derived impediments. Hence, via the exploratory case study of two retailing organizations, a typology of the barriers to market orientation development at the shopfloor level is presented. Implications for theorists and practitioners are identified and an action plan discussed.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>What happens when users encounter breakdown situations when browsing the Web? Reports a study in which 35 participants were asked to think aloud whilst following a trail through a series of Web pages. Some of the pages were designed to cause error messages to be displayed by the browser when users tried to interact with them. The results from the study showed that the error messages did not help users to diagnose the cause of the problems, or develop their understanding of the Internet. Error messages do provide a vocabulary for describing problems, but fail to provide a model to pin the terminology on. We suggest that an underlying model of Web browsing should be available for users to learn from the error messages, rather than just seeing them as a sign of “something being wrong”.</jats:p>",

In this paper two methods, vector transformation and tensor transformation, for calculation of the rotational motion of particles in response to applied moments are presented. The methods consider the inertia tensor and the local object frame of arbitrary shaped particles and suggest solutions for the non‐linear Euler equations for calculation of their rotational motion.

In a multicultural world, cultural heterogeneity will continue to remain the most significant barrier to one global market. Cultures are resilient and enduring and so is the concept of global multiculturalism. At the global level, trading blocs may be viewed as a cluster of geographically close countries that share abstract and/or material culture in varying degrees. It is interesting to note that the three major regional trading blocs (i.e. the European Union, North American Free Trade Agreement, and the Association of South East Asian Nations) can be characterized by significant differences in culture. With the rapid emergence of trading blocs in the multicultural market, our paper attempts to meet several objectives. First, we discuss the growing importance and underlying motives of regional trading blocs in a multicultural setting. The level of trading arrangements between nations is described and a brief overview of the three major trading blocs is then presented. The level of heterogeneity of each trading bloc is examined with implications for market segmentation. The critical role of strategic alliances in the context of regional trading blocs is discussed next. Finally, we recommend marketing strategies for firms marketing to countries within its trading bloc as well as to countries outside its trading bloc.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Completion of the European Single Market Programme in Financial Services has, as expected, set in motion a rationalisation process within the European banking industry, as banks respond to increasing competitive pressures that are having a dampening effect on their traditional business margins. Assesses the importance of these developments in the context of the policy options that are open to the European banking community in the new millennium. In particular, given the prospect of an integrated European economy, now commonly referred to as Euroland, the paper addresses, as its central theme, the potential for the development of pan‐European banks that would then be in a position to configure longer‐term globalisation strategies. Evolution in this direction, if it occurs, is important from a European Central Bank policy perspective, since it would raise systemic risk issues if a small number of European licensed banks became “too big to fail”. We conclude, however, that the most prominent strategic response is likely to be based on the European “regionalisation” of banks and markets rather than pan‐Europeanisation.</jats:p>",

In this paper, the authors respond to Sheedy’s call for further research through an empirical examination of the  over‐the‐counter equity derivatives market in the USA and Britain, arguing that while relationships in this market do, to a limited degree, exhibit characteristics atypical of wider financial services contexts, the relationship paradigm continues to be relevant, and indeed inherent, to over‐the‐counter derivative exchange.</jats:p>",

A grounded model is derived which shows the critical factors in regard to the principles of TQM, when quality models are applied in an SME context. The findings indicate TQM, when a quality model is applied in an SME context. The findings indicate that SMEs can be compromised by the mechanistic and formalised nature of such models, which the SMEs consider as adding bureaucracy, while needing to remain flexible and innovative in a very dynamic environment over which they have little control.</jats:p>",

Conventional individual control chart design does not address the problem of the interrelation of the processes adequately. Owing to the increasing complexity of manufacturing systems as well as the problems caused by the natural variability of the systems, trial‐and‐error methods are the most commonly used technique for the implementation of the control charts. Trial‐and‐error methods are very costly, time consuming and highly disruptive to the real system. Hence, a systematic and holistic computer‐based methodology is proposed in this paper to obtain a control chart configuration which improves productivity and quality, and reduces cost. Simulation is used as a platform to conduct the control chart system design because different scenarios can be tested off‐line so that statistical process control can be performed effectively without making costly mistakes and disturbing the real system.</jats:p>",

This has been done by analysing benchmarking data collected from nearly 450 service organisations from the North East of England.

In small‐batch manufacture, however, such techniques can be difficult to implement due to lack of sufficient data to establish control decisions for control charts. Most of the early proposed solutions emphasized the product rather than the process, whereas many of the recently developed approaches favoured monitoring the process and not the product. All such approaches suggest the use of data transformation. The aim is to normalize the differences in the process mean and the variability for different components. Once an appropriate transformation is made, then sample data related to different components can be plotted on the same chart using sample statistics of the transformed data. An important part of transformation is the determination of process parameters for the component. Several methods for determining such parameters have already been suggested in the literature.

We assume that components of the system follow an exponential failure law and investigate expected times to failure of systems of various levels of component redundancy which have been exposed to acceptance sampling plans of various levels of stringency. We also show the probability distributions of system reliability for outgoing lots at various levels of component redundancy and sampling stringency. The paper shows a straightforward method for calculating these trade‐offs and provides the decision maker with a previously unavailable tool of system design and testing.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This study reports the experience of management from 83 electronic plants located in the USA in dealing with time‐based performance. The general finding is that by managing time effectively, a firm is able to enjoy reductions in manufacturing cost, warranty cost, and more importantly increased market shares. Also, despite some prominent features offered by some of the more advanced quality related techniques, such as quality function deployment technique (QFD) and the Taguchi methods, our survey showed that very few electronic firms in the sample have actually adopted either of these two techniques. Yet consistent with the robustness of these theories, results indicate that those firms embracing these methods experienced a greater reduction in product development time. Thus, our study has important implications for manufacturing firms, particularly those which are still searching for better ways to improve their product development time. For example, according to Ray Stata, the president of Analog Device “The thing that hung us up for the longest time in the product development area is that we didn’t have anybody in the company who had a clue as to how to improve product development. It wasn’t that we didn’t think it was important, but how do you do it?”.</jats:p>",

The implementation of TQM is particularly difficult in this environment. Based on case studies of 20 TQM firms and practical consultancy experience in mainland China, this paper analyses the difficulties in implementing quality management and offers a number of suggestions for step by step implementation of TQM. As found in our studies, manufacturers may institute the necessary changes in both organizational quality culture and management systems progressively by assessing their unique operational environment and the practical improvements achieved on a continuous basis. Matrix organizations with project teams may provide them with a smoother transition from traditional organizational structure to team based structures in TQM. Those changes in management systems and organizational cultures may be supported by the necessary organizational policies, further instituted and sustained by the adoption of the ISO 9000 quality management system.</jats:p>",

Accountability is founded in democracy and is also the principle used as the basis of financial and other forms of accounting, auditing and reporting. In accountability’s relationship to sustainability, however, there has been little clarity. Sustainability – defined broadly by the concept of the triple bottom line – is underpinned by three forms of accountability: social‐ethical, environmental and economic accountability. With the introduction of a new social standard AA1000, the difficult‐to‐bridge gaps within the sustainability debate – between morality and science, measurement and performance, inclusion and exclusion – are addressed using a model of accountability.

Gannon summarizes and embellishes on three influential studies comparing cultures across dimensions, and employs all of the dimensions, in addition to several others, to craft metaphors that illustrate cultural differences among 17 countries. Utilizes Gannon’s metaphors to explore the cultural dimensions and contrast the related management control system design implications for the USA, Japan, China, Germany, Italy, and India. First, provides a framework and purpose for management control systems. Next, explores the elements of management control systems that might be particularly sensitive to cultural diversity. Then, compares and contrasts potential MCS design issues related to these elements across cultures. Finally, proposes directions for research addressing management control systems and cultural differences.</jats:p>",

To ascertain the effect of audit technology on probabilistic judgement in auditing, 78 employees of ten offices of national Certified Public Accountant (CPA) firms ‐ 40 from unstructured firms and 38 from structured ones ‐ were surveyed. Findings indicate that public accountants’ probabilistic judgements were influenced by their firms’ audit technology structure and that the imposition of structure caused auditors to rely more on provided cues than on the use of judgement. These results help support Mintzberg’s suggestion that CPA firms modify their audit approaches to fit specific situations. For example, they should use structured approaches for clients with continuing good earnings announcements and less‐structured approaches for poorly performing clients.</jats:p>",

Significant experience in TQM/TQC prior to competing for a quality award may moderate these risks. For managers, there should be serious consideration as to whether their companies should compete for a quality award in the hope of improving performance.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>There is growing concern in college management about the quality of education in tertiary institutions. For related studies, people normally encounter the problems of developing measurement indicators and identifying components of quality education. Some people use SERVQUAL, a technique making use of the gap between customers’ expectations and perceived experience as indicators of service quality, to measure quality of services offered by professionals such as physicians. Hampton applied the technique to identify and measure the significance of different components of quality education, by using the questionnaire designed by Betz, Klingensmith and Menne. Hampton’s findings sound reasonable but seem to be too simplified and confined to the characteristics of students in the USA. The expectations and perceptions of the students are often shaped and influenced by their cultural orientation and environments. Hong Kong students who are more pragmatic and instrumental may value less the significance of campus life on quality education but put more stress on assessment. This study is designed to apply the modified SERVQUAL skill to examine Hampton’s findings with reference to the students in a different social and cultural context. It is hoped that a list of quality indicators can be identified against which the performance of the higher educational institutes can be measured.</jats:p>",

The Acts raised awareness of the need for efficient and adequate internal control systems to prevent illegal acts such as the bribery of foreign officials, political parties and governments to secure or maintain contracts overseas. Its uniqueness is also due to the fact that the USA is the first country to pioneer such a legislation that impacted foreign trade, international law and codes of ethics. The research traces the history of the FCPA before and after its enactment, the role played by the various branches of the United States Government – Congress, Department of Justice, Securities Exchange commission (SEC), Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS); the contributions made by professional associations such as the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICFA), the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA), the American Bar Association (ABA); and, finally, the role played by various international organizations such as the United Nations (UN), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC).

The article explores the role of the consultant in delivery suite from the view point of a consultant, a clinical director, a training programme director and a chief executive. These viewpoints determine a range of common themes which mean the duties of consultants over their career lifecycle need to be addressed; the need to expand consultant posts; and the tensions which inevitably occur. The authors believe these need to be addressed because of the need to ensure consultant roles in delivery suite are developed as a key part of seeing quality improvement.</jats:p>",

This article considers the implications for this debate of results from a project designed to elicit the views of users of out of hours primary care provision. Focus groups were used to gauge definitions of “out of hours” services, factors governing the use of some services rather than others and influences on the evaluation of different options. The centrality accorded by patients to the social dimensions of a more “traditional” relationship with family doctors was central to the selection and evaluation of alternative provision. Any significant initiative in the reconfiguration of local health care services might thus be regarded as much a social enterprise as a technical challenge based on the most equitable and efficient application of resources.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper proposes a diagnostic framework useful to Trust managers who are faced with the task of devising and implementing strategies for improvements in clinical effectiveness, and is based on a recent study incorporating clinicians, managers, and professional staff in four NHS Trusts in the North Thames Region. The gap framework is inspired by the gap model developed by Zeithaml, Parasuraman and Berry from their research into service quality and incorporates Dave Sackett’s schema as well as a personal competency profile needed for the practice of evidence based health‐care (EBHC). The paper highlights the four organisational and personal failures (gaps) which contribute to the fifth gap, namely the discrepancy between clinically relevant research evidence and its implement‐ation in health care. To close the gaps, Trusts need to set the goal and tackle the cultural, organisational, attitudinal and more material aspects such as investment in the information infrastructure, education and training of doctors. Doctors need to go through a process from awareness to action facilitated through a combination of personal and organisational incentives and rewards as well as training in the requisite skills. Researchers should take steps to improve the quality of the evidence and its accessibility and purchasers should reinforce the use of EBHC by withdrawing funding for care which has proved to be ineffective, inappropriate or inferior.</jats:p>",

These findings are of relevance to the development of commissioning by primary care groups in light of the Government’s proposal that contracts be replaced by long‐term service agreements as competition within the NHS internal market is replaced by more collaborative arrangements between commissioners and providers. The paper identifies features of the contracting process which have been instrumental to the achievement of TPPs’ service development objectives and may need to be preserved to ensure effective commissioning within the context of the new service agreements.</jats:p>",

The focus for the study were doctors who had agreed to undertake the lead partner role in the now‐defunct general practitioner fundholding initiative within the UK National Health Service. The findings indicate widespread reluctance but the presence of a minority of enthusiasts, which resonates with previous studies of secondary care settings. A finding of potential significance for future research and practice was that some doctors who were initially reluctant became more keen on undertaking a management role once they had experienced it.</jats:p>",

The growing demand for miniaturization of electronics means that finer lines and smaller vias are increasingly required and these very fine lines on the substrate are increasingly difficult to produce by conventional means. One very promising means of meeting these fine line requirements is via the etching of sputtered thin films on a substrate and then growing copper on these lines using an additive method. In this work we tested the capability of an electrodeposited, positive‐acting photoresist for patterning thin film circuits on sputtered seed layers such as chromium. A fully additive electroless copper was then used to produce the copper lines. Epoxy reinforced fibreglass was used as a core material. The performance and quality properties of the process were examined, along with limitations of the process when compared with both a conventional dry film method and a spin coating method.</jats:p>",

The application of such technology frequently violates traditional ethical, moral and religious values. This paper, after outlining possible benefits of modern new biotechnologies, discusses the type of biosafety risks which they pose, their possible adverse consequences for the sustainability of biodiversity and agriculture and their potential impacts on socioeconomic welfare and traditional cultures. Particular concern is expressed about the possible consequences of such technologies for developing countries and the practice in some developed countries of issuing patents conferring very broad rights over the use of genetically engineered material. Because these rights are so broad, in some cases they have the potential to establish powerful multinational monopolies in the hands of private companies. Global debate about these issues suggests that more emphasis should be given globally to the socio‐economic consequences of such technology than in the past. The need for this is highlighted by the North‐South divide. Developing countries lag considerably in this new technological field, are placed in a dependent position and have weak institutional structures to control the application of such technology.</jats:p>",

This paper uses the policy analysis matrix (PAM) to assess efficiency in the crop sector and financial analysis to explore the potential of investing in a fruit juice extraction plant in Malawi. The PAM revealed that farmers in Malawi are efficient producers but they face negative incentives in the production and marketing of their products. The nominal protection coefficients (NPCs) for both maize and beans were less than 1 while those of inputs were more than 1. Similarly, the effective protection coefficients (EPCs) were less than 1, implying that the combined effect of transfers and tradable inputs is reducing the private profitability of the systems. On the other hand, the financial analysis demonstrated that Malawi can sustain a fruit juice extraction plant. The project had a positive net present value and a benefit/cost ratio greater than 1 (1.16). Recommendations made from the study relate to the need for diversification into fruits that can sustain a fruit juice extraction plant, encouraging private sector participation and reducing disincentives to crop production.</jats:p>",

However, some reconciliation of the Christian and Islamic view is possible when we recognize that the ethical accountability of interest rests on a view of economic justice as increasing the degree of economic participation in an economy as an economic and social good.

Subscribing to the extremely contestable argument that there is a connection between private property rights and the performance and prosperity of capitalism, de‐socialization of ownership was to become the backbone for market oriented reforms in post‐communist society. The absence of clearly defined property rights, their capricious enforcement, widespread cronyism and criminal activity, in combination with a lack of resolution to terminate the quasi‐property rights of the former ruling elite, and imperfect markets have created a situation where, in the final analysis, the original foundation of most rights to property and wealth would hardly survive the test of justice and be validated in any socially responsible society. Moral precepts aside, given these circumstances, it would be hard for an economist to argue that the present process of re‐allocation of rights could be explained on efficiency grounds.</jats:p>",

Would deregulation create employment? Argues against labour market deregulation in South Africa. Posits that new markets in which the country can be internationally competitive have yet to become apparent and that it would be inappropriate, in light of the country’s economic and human resource base, to cheapen labour in the search for that market. Concludes that such a move in South Africa would widen the incomes gap, subsidize labour inefficiency and undermine long‐term productivity gains. While the “low road” to international competitiveness might yield short‐term results, it is urged that the long‐term social costs would be too high. In sum, argues that labour market policy should place more attention on improvement of human resources and labour market institutions and on the broadening of domestic and regional markets.</jats:p>",

Based on these, and with some exceptions, shows that during the first years of transition, 1989‐1992, the poorer republics were better off than the others on both accounts. Out of the factors suggested as possible explanations to the better performance of group III countries, three seem important: the higher rate of substitution between private and public sector employment generated by the agricultural sector; a larger labour demand elasticity, and a more moderate rate of increase in labour supply, caused by very little reduction in state sector employment.</jats:p>",

This has been by and large to the detriment of ecology for two reasons: first, much of the neo‐classical economics (the economics of resource allocation) is based on untested and highly improbable assumptions about behaviour in the real world. Efforts to validate this theory in ecological contexts have not been very successful and, further, have themselves been based on inadequate methods. Second, applications of economic theories of optimization to natural resource allocations have led to depletion rather than conservation of resources because they are based on unfounded assumptions about the natural world and the capability for self‐renewal of natural resource systems. Further, viewing nature as a “commodity” focuses on only one aspect of nature’s services and even here is inadequate, for it fails to account for renewal over long time horizons. Emerging conceptual frameworks based on ecological economics hold more promise in forging the much needed integration of economics and ecology. Their value may be realized if some of the “blinders” that govern economic thought can be shed in meeting the critical challenge of an ecologically sustainable and ethical future. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Bangladesh has experienced a rapid expansion of shrimp farming in the coastal regions in recent years. The increase in both area and production has been influenced by the financial profit motive of rural farmers coupled with high international demands for shrimps and ecological congeniality for shrimp aquaculture. In the past the traditional farming systems in the coastal belts of Bangladesh centred around rice crop. In contrast, the introduction of shrimp aquaculture on a larger/commercial scale has developed shrimp‐based farming systems. Shrimp farming itself is less labour‐intensive than rice cultivation, especially when extensive methods of shrimp culture are practised. Hence, it has reduced on‐farm employment opportunities for rural landless. Nevertheless, shrimp production requires a substantial volume of labour in off‐farm ancillary activities, namely shrimp fry collection, shrimp feed collection, and shrimp processing and packaging for export. Most of this off‐farm work is performed primarily by rural women. This process has engendered a major shift in rural employment and occupational structure in the shrimp belt. Shrimp production has enabled rural women to earn more cash income and to become more active income‐earning members in rural households. While they used to contribute to their share of agricultural work in the homestead before the shrimp cultivation was introduced, now they work mostly outside their homes. This has forced them to stay outside of their homes for longer hours, which limits their time for household duties, more specifically looking after children. All these factors together have implications for the socio‐economic changes in the rural society. The findings that emerge indicate that a range of factors including rural power structure, centre‐periphery issue, rural‐urban migration determine the pattern and extent of employment. It is unclear whether greater employment opportunities for rural women have empowered them or have helped extricate them from various forms of discrimination and exploitation.</jats:p>",

Since the end of the 1970s China had abandoned Mao Zedong’s socioeconomic theories and policies and instituted profound socioeconomic reforms. Her more pragmatic approach has increasingly emphasized economic freedom and individualism. The pursued “pragmatism” involves a revolutionary mixture of both a planned and a market economy with greater economic but not political freedom. Essential socioeconomic reforms were not complemented by requisite political reforms. According to Walter Eucken’s “instability thesis,” this may de‐stabilize China’s socioeconomic and political structures. The challenge which China continues to face is how to reconcile two sets of conflicting principles, economic freedom and Marxist‐Leninist‐Maoist control of politics and society, resolving Eucken’s hypothesis of potential long‐term instability.

Economic growth in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s was seen as a panacea for reducing poverty. While the key to development progress is still achieving economic growth, the means to do so is based on the ability of governments to move towards a free market type economy. The concern today is the impact of economic structural adjustment policies (SAPs) on the levels of poverty and inequality. In most cases the evidence on the impact of SAPs shows that despite sustained economic growth the poverty level has increased in many developing countries and Fiji is not an exception. The move towards free market reforms is being increasingly questioned as a policy measure and its ability to have positive impact on the reduction of poverty and income inequality. The criticism of the free market approach is its failure to take account of institutional, social and political factors which in many cases are the real causes of poverty and income inequality.

This failure is due to the employment of an “ideal” economic world’s assumptions that do not, and cannot, fit the real world of business. The argument in the paper begins with a discussion of the ideal market as envisioned by the Chicago School and outlined in Tisdell (1995). From this ideal market characterization, it is argued that even Adam Smith recognized the existence of external effects resulting from certain social undertakings. In addition to externalities, two other market failures are discussed: the use of efficiency measures while ignoring effectiveness measures; and the emphasis on the short‐term time horizon at the expense of the longer term.</jats:p>",

During his terms of office he followed a Keynesian policy that placed on the government the responsibility for sustaining full employment. His policy involved not only the finance of the public sector but also the maintenance of equilibrium between production and expenditure. To achieve this he introduced a standardization of budget policy ‐ structural finance. The essence of this budgetary policy, which the Dutch Government pursued from 1960 to 1978, was to manage the national expenditure in a designed manner. The article deals with this approach and suggests an explanation why it eventually failed to produce the expected results.</jats:p>",

Although most neo‐classical economists now agree that market prices may substantially undervalue biological features, the prevailing view is that “correct” market prices can be established through enlightened intervention in private markets. Using the examples of the Atlantic bluefin tuna, the American bison, and the passenger pigeon, we show that neither very high nor very low prices can ensure the survival of a particular species. With these cases as background, we compare and contrast three policy approaches to sustainability: weak sustainability, strong sustainability and Georgescu‐Roegen’s concept of a viable technology.</jats:p>",

Second, the implications of this new‐found support for the market system, its institutions and their working require some clarification. Third, essential qualifications remain: private and social morality must guide economic freedom, just legal framework is required, and government surveillance must remain especially of distribution. Fourth, today’s market system, now operating globally, has given rise to new needs for ensuring adequate employment with security of tenure. Firms and public agencies should see themselves as “communities of persons” concerned with the welfare of their employees. Finally, this discussion of the market economy takes issue with those who confuse a morally directed version with one reflecting automatic forces, and with others who think a desirable economic system and policy and the premises of economic science cannot be influenced by Christian thought.</jats:p>",

This paper compares the Neoclassical and Christian positions via analysis of characteristics of the Neoclassical rational choice model. The main characteristic examined is a basic assumption of the rational choice model that human choice is explained as the optimisation of utility via rational self‐interest. The two positions are compared in terms of how they treat self‐interest and rationality, the degree to which basic assumptions about human behaviour are specified, the importance they attach to the realism of assumptions underlying their models, and the explanatory and predictive purposes for which the models are used. The conclusion of the comparison is that the Biblical Christian perspective encompasses the variables regarded as important in Neoclassical explanation, but presents them in the context of a more embracing worldview perspective than the Neoclassical. This Christian belief perspective is applicable to human behaviour in both “economic” and “non‐economic” domains.</jats:p>",

To get a better understanding  of the functioning of a welfare state and its competitiveness, this article discusses the concept of “solidarity” and its counterpart “rivalry”. In orthodox ethics solidarity is interpreted as a moral imperative; in orthodox economics eventual transfers are costs that must be justified by utilities derived from it (through the avoidance of social unrest for instance). By applying the usual investment formula to decide whether an investment would be profitable, this article shows that decisions about solidarity transfers are influenced by morality, mentality, rationality and the apparent belief systems of the decision takers. Because “modern” sociology does not pay adequate attention to the sources of human rivalry, the contributions of the linguist and anthropologist Girard are discussed to see whether this offers a valuable approach.</jats:p>",

Through an analysis of the socioeconomic development of Wuxi and Jiangyin, three trends in future development of rural urbanization can be predicted: rural population will continue to progress from lower to higher level and from incomplete to complete form; small towns will continue to develop rapidly and differentially; and rural migrants in regional cities will gradually increase.</jats:p>",

This policy is designed to simultaneously increase the human capital of young workers as well as help to overcome the initial barriers to entry into the labour market. However, youth‐specific wages have been criticized on the basis of age discrimination and on equity grounds. Also, some US data question the employment‐boosting potential of reduced minimum youth wages. In this paper recent international findings on the relationship between youth wages and employment are presented and compared with empirical tests of the relationship using labour market data for Australia as a whole as well as the State of Queensland. The results are used to examine the likely impact of the introduction of the training wage on the youth labour market in Australia and to provide further generalizations on the wider issue of employment and youth‐specific wages.</jats:p>",

The Huntington thesis – that the world is now divided into rival civilisations and that they are likely to be the source of the next round of world conflicts – may seem weak in the light of this. In fact many people fear that economic efficiency will produce a single culture and, because it will be dominated by hotly competing corporations with little restraint, will threaten civility itself. R.G. Collingwood even argued that economics as a practical science threatens civilisation by its very existence. This paper argues that, if one takes seriously Collingwood’s own distinction between wealth and riches, and if a co‐operative economy can be made to flourish, civilisation can readily survive. Wealth in these terms is a community resource which frees up human possibilities, riches are personal barricades and a source of power, and we can understand how to maximise wealth without creating unnecessary riches. In these terms the three main competing civilisations – that of the West, that of Islam, and the Chinese civilisation which is exemplified, for instance in Taiwan, may well survive and remain distinct. They represent basic human choices. For one can have societies in which the major focus is on individuals, societies in which it is on the community as a whole, and societies in which it is on families, social groups, churches and other institutions which comprise civil society.</jats:p>",

The shift from socialist democratization under Gorbachev to capitalist transformation under Yeltsin had multiple origins; but a core element in the process was the very likely abandonment of the ancien régime by party, state, and industrial élites themselves. Key factors in the transition in the early 1990s were: continuity amid change in political leadership and governance institutions; the absence of a developed political party system that could have united Yeltsin and the new Russian parliament; and the underlying socioeconomic conditions and attitudes of the Russian population.</jats:p>",

Distinguishes between what is termed loud lobbying, typically a highly visible media relations campaign providing an information subsidy to carefully targeted media, for marketing purposes; and quiet lobbying, discreet use of links with legislators, in order to encourage or block legislation. A model is given to aid clarification. The distinction is illustrated using examples of loud and quiet lobbying, including a case study of the campaigns for and against resale price maintenance (RPM). This shows Asda’s lobbying campaign to have been essentially a key element of the company’s marketing strategy. Concludes that the objectives of a lobbying campaign are crucial in determining whether loud or quiet lobbying would be more appropriate.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Firms with a strong service orientation – that is, those whose organizational policies, practices, and procedures support service excellence – often have a competitive edge in mature Western markets. In transitional economies, however – such as within the newly opened markets of Central and Eastern Europe – the impact of service orientation on current and future firm performance is largely unknown. Particularly, in areas where service quality has lagged, enhancing service orientation might catapult a firm’s competitive standing ahead of the pack. On the other hand, boosting service orientation in markets where demand continues to outpace supply may add unnecessary cost, and little visible short‐term gain. In this study, the SERV*OR scale, a measure of organizational service orientation, was administered to 105 employees from two Slovenian banks – a newly established private bank and a large, older, state‐supported bank. The private bank outperformed the state bank in service orientation and in financial performance, lending support to the idea that service orientation may enhance rather than detract from firm performance in transitional markets.</jats:p>",

Since then, and due to its attractive and appealing features, systolic approach has been gaining great momentum to the point where all 2D‐array parallelization attempts were exclusively systolic. As good result, latency has been successively reduced a number of times (5<jats:italic>N</jats:italic>, 3<jats:italic>N</jats:italic>, 2<jats:italic>N</jats:italic>, 3<jats:italic>N</jats:italic>/2), where <jats:italic>N</jats:italic> is the matrix size. But as latency was getting lower, further irregularities were introduced into the array, making the implementation severely compromised either at VLSI level or at system level. The best illustrative case of such irregularities are the two designs proposed by Tsay and Chang in 1995 and considered as the fastest designs (3<jats:italic>N</jats:italic>/2) that have been developed so far.

Postulating a consistent mathematical formulation, the novel methodology introduces a set of general vector parametric equations that describe wave propagation in both media and facilitate the effective treatment of the remarkably complex, arbitrarily‐aligned (non‐uniform) source or mean flow terms, particularly at low frequencies. The discretization procedure is performed via accurate higher‐order FDTD topological concepts, which along with a well‐posed variable transformation, suppress the undesired lattice dispersion and anisotropy errors. Hence, due to these additional degrees of design freedom and their optimal establishment, the new stable PMLs (split‐field or Maxwellian) accomplish a critical attenuation of the evanescent, vorticity or elastic wave families by carefully accounting for every loss mechanism. Numerical investigation reveals the superiority of the proposed technique in terms of various open‐region, waveguide and ducted‐domain simulations.</jats:p>",

Of the 299 libraries surveyed, 250 surveys were returned for a response rate of 83.6 percent. Analysis of the responses emphasizes the number and types of computers available in libraries, electronic resources in libraries, past and future cancellation decisions and archiving responsibilities. It was determined that both ARL and non‐ARL libraries offer extensive electronic services to their constituents. Libraries are beginning to cancel paper journals in favor of electronic versions.

Where firms are unable to enter a market because it is blocked by trade barriers, some researchers suggest managers engage in specific entry strategies or strategic actions to overcome barriers. This study, based on in‐depth interviews with insurance executives, shows that trade barriers are one of several factors managers evaluate when deciding whether to enter a market.

Key changes concerned the placement of much greater emphasis on clinical information needs by route of the Electronic Patient Record (EPR) and the Electronic Health Record (EHR). The last decade has seen unprecedented changes within the NHS due to government policies, political ideology, health‐care reform and pace of technological progress. This paper argues that this rate and scale of change has outstripped the ability of health‐care organisations to respond effectively in order to implement the key goals set by strategic policy makers. An historical review is combined with an analysis of recent empirical survey data to determine the evolution and progress of the NHS IM&amp;T strategy over a period of ten years. The review and analysis is enabled by adopting techniques and theory derived from research within the field of Information Systems, whereby Information Systems maturity models are used as an heuristic to measure levels of sophistication of IT adoption and use. These models demonstrate that NHS hospitals are fairly immature in terms of the adoption and usage of information systems and technology; struggling to provide adequate foundations for systems integration (data, work and culture). Conclusions reflect on the current progress and ambition of the strategy and comment on its potential outcome given existing NHS knowledge of IT, skills, capability and infrastructure.</jats:p>",

Governments have been able to put an ideological gloss on managerial strategies to suit local political agendas. The spread of this policy, where public servants have their roles transformed to managers and the public to customers, serves to strengthen demonstration of the diminishing role of government and the increasing reliance on the market. Through our research on managerialism in local government in Victoria, we show that there has been a repackaging of the senior council manager into an idealised private sector version.

In particular, the introduction of the “National Reference Costing Exercise” (NRCE) has substantively changed the way in which health care cost information is reported and used. While the outputs of the NRCE are intended to support hospital management and control by facilitating cost benchmarking, the usefulness of NRCE data depends on the comparability of cost information across hospitals. This paper draws on questionnaire results to explore the challenges in standardising health care cost information, as perceived by those closest to the costing exercise. The results reveal several problems in costing practice, all of which contribute to high variability in the costs reported by hospitals. Until these problems are recognised and addressed, they present a barrier to the effective use of comparative cost data for the management of English hospitals.</jats:p>",

Shows, from analysis of variance of efficiency indicators of a longitudinal sample of 108 firms over the period 1988‐1992, that increasing levels of competition trigger corresponding increases in the overall level of technical efficiency of state‐owned enterprises that face competitive conditions. Provides a persuasive case for introducing competitive markets as an alternative to complete privatization, especially in monopolisitc settings.</jats:p>",

There are many interrelated pressures for change, some of the key ones being the need to contain public spending (to under 40 per cent GNP?) in the face of ever increasing global competition, changing demographic and employment patterns, increasing need and demand for services, and the need to find innovative solutions to obdurate problems of local levels ‐ health, housing, community safety, unemployment and so on. Above all, this will require greater productivity; changing skill boundaries, demarcations and mixes; far greater applications of technology and innovative community‐based multi‐agency working ‐ beyond rhetoric. Unfortunately, much current research, scholarship and commentary is “locked into” individual public sectors ‐ health, education, public administration and so on. This means that it is likely to be informed by existing frames of reference which already lie within these sectors. A wider flow of ideas, theory and critical analysis across private and all public sectors could lead to the development of new paradigms of insight, understanding and practice. This would prove a further impetus for a bottom‐up social movement with a communitarianist agenda. Unfortunately this is most unlikely to be promoted top‐ down because most politicians are also “locked into” the binary thinking of Fordist modernism.</jats:p>",

The application is concerned with the introduction within Norway of an approach to the production of judgemental information relating to clients, and for its subsequent utilisation in a national system. The framework, known as GERIX, is intended to ensure that assistance and support is provided on a fair and equitable basis across the nation. The approach is centred on a set of criteria designed to enable a comprehensive review of a client situation to be undertaken. Data for a client, utilising the criteria, are based on judgemental assessments by professionals. It is, therefore, critical for all involved in these assessments to understand and apply the model in a consistent way. Results strongly suggest that the approach to group process support enhances individual learning of professionals who are required to utilise the GERIX framework.</jats:p>",

The relative strengths of four dimensions of culture in this organisation were measured using Hofstede’s instrument. Added to this were items from a questionnaire developed by Ryder and Southey, derived from the Jones and James instrument measuring psychological climate and providing scores across six specific dimensions of organisational climate. Measures of managerial values, drawn from a questionnaire by Flowers and Hughes, were also incorporated. Results show that levels of culture within this particular organisation are at variance with those reported by Hofstede from his Australian data. Findings indicate a strong link between specific organisational climate items and a number of managerial values dimensions. Additional relationships between particular dimensions of culture, climate and managerial values are also reported. From this, a hypothesised, predictive model of linkages between the constructs is presented.</jats:p>",

The political concept of power is used in examining the accounting standard setting process at the UN, in the context of regulatory reforms of the TNCs. While alternative models of power are considered, Robert Dahl’s decision‐oriented pluralistic model was adopted in the study because it proved to be the most consistent with the events, objectives and the empirical data presented. The research findings indicate that organized pressures from the TNCs, co‐ordinated under the joint forum of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and the International Organisation of Employers (IOE), coupled with the economic and diplomatic manoeuvring of the developed market economy nations, had succeeded in overriding the rule of “one‐nation‐one‐vote” and securing a<jats:italic>de facto</jats:italic>veto over the majority view at the UN.

By examining professional discourse, as evidenced in practitioner journals, we explore accountants’ constructions of potential roles for themselves in this new field.

The focus has been on efficiency, effectiveness and value for money of public sector operations. The methods by which governments account and report on their operations has received scrutiny. While Treasuries and Departments of Finance in each Australian jurisdiction have traditionally formulated the reporting and accounting rules used in the public sector, since 1983, with the formation of the Public Sector Accounting Standards Board (PSASB), the accounting profession has become involved in the setting of accounting standards for the public sector. Several researchers have suggested that a “contest” exists between the accounting profession and the government regulators for control over the public sector accounting standards process. This paper explores the processes whereby the public sector in Australia formulates its financial reporting policies by examining the interactions between the PSASB and the government regulators in each of the Australian jurisdictions. Policy community and policy network theory are used to argue that policy is formulated by a “cooperative” grouping of accounting professionals from the central agencies of Treasuries and Departments of Finance and the PSASB. The paper concludes that this method of policy formulation has implications for the content of policy and for the access of stakeholders to the formulation of that policy.</jats:p>",

Of those hospitals and services which have implemented TQM, few have had great success and many have found difficulties sustaining their programmes. This paper defines TQM in healthcare and considers examples and results of TQM in European healthcare. It distinguishes between team projects using TQM methods and organization‐wide TQM programmes, and finds more evidence for the success of projects than for programmes. The paper discusses whether the differences between healthcare and many other industries explain the mixed results, and considers the prospects for future TQM programmes in European healthcare.</jats:p>",

The consumerist methodology for the strategy described in this paper was designed to maximise staff involvement in capturing user views, in order to develop services at a district general hospital. This strategy – the Patient Care Development Programme (PCDP) – provides a framework for both staff and patient involvement in shaping and influencing the development of health‐care services. Uses the findings from applying the strategy to modify care packages, roles, skills, layouts, protocols and procedures, in response to both the “shortfalls” and the service strengths that the patient’s view uncovers. Discusses the results of an evaluation of the programme which has been replicated in another part of the UK. The PCDP now forms part of a clinical governance framework and is being used to develop multi‐agency integrated care pathways.</jats:p>",

However, this was only the case when a number of factors were taken into consideration. For instance, the Directorate found that the change programme required a phased implementation process, sound leadership, expert facilitation, good information systems, numerous training and development opportunities for managers, teamwork and the application of best practice in relation to project improvement teams. Moreover, the absence of all the aforementioned ingredients had the potential to compromise any successful outcome.</jats:p>",

A prospective study was conducted in Kisumu District, a region characterized by high incidences of maternal and infant mortality, to determine the levels and prevalence of maternal complications.

All the obstetric‐related cases were recorded between January and July 1997, and the outcomes of the pregnancies were recorded. Details on the respondents socioeconomic, demographic, biomedical and environment characteristics were also recorded. A total of 1,455 cases were recorded, of which 59 percent experienced obstetric‐related complications. Of those with complications, 22 percent were suffering from severe anaemia. Among other things, the study reveals that anaemia prevalence is determined by maternal and environmental factors. These include poor pregnancy care, illness during pregnancy, socioeconomic conditions of the mother and the sanitary conditions of the household.

Clinical inquiry is the observation, eliciting and reporting of data which are available when the researcher is engaged in a helping relationship in the management of change. Its core elements are: the client wanting help and, therefore, being more likely to reveal important data; the clinical researcher being expected to intervene, allowing new data about the client system to surface; and the richness of the data allowing the clinical researcher to develop deep insights into the client system. Interlevel dynamics, as an extension of levels of analysis, are useful diagnostic and intervention constructs for the clinical researcher who is helping an organisation manage change. They can be used to point out areas of systemic dysfunction and intervention. A case example of clinical inquiry in an IT‐organisational change context illustrates the systemic nature of clinical inquiry in dealing with human, organisational and technological issues at, and between, the individual, team, interdepartmental group and organisational levels.</jats:p>",

To investigate actual problem‐solving behavior of front‐line workers, we conducted 197 hours of observation of hospital nurses, whose jobs present many problem‐solving opportunities.

Good quality management in NPD concerning all three types of quality is only achieved when, in addition to the so‐called system‐technical approach, ample attention is paid to the social dynamics of NPD management. Social dynamics are a main element of dynamic NPD management, which further comprises configurational dynamics and the balancing of short‐ and long‐term NPD performance (again in terms of EQ, IQ and PQ). Three clusters of social‐dynamical aspects are worked out conceptually, operationalized and linked to performance: leadership, collective mind and narratives. Based on a multiple case study research, empirical findings will be presented concerning social‐dynamical aspects in practice. In our conclusions we will also reflect upon the usefulness of these concepts for further theory development in the area of dynamic NPD management related to TQM.</jats:p>",

Despite an acknowledgement of the existence of this relationship, there is a paucity of research which seeks to investigate the key issues involved. A grounded theory research methodology was developed using 19 grounded case studies of organisations which were involved in TQM and which had well‐developed strategic planning processes. First, it was found that there was an inconsistency in TQM terminology, especially in regard to TQM’s integration with the strategic planning process. Second, TQM was only articulated as a means of achieving a target, which has been set at strategic level. Finally, the results indicated that TQM plays a key role in strategy implementation, as distinct from strategic formulation, within the organisations.</jats:p>",

Country risk ratios and the profile of foreign debts for the majority of these countries are near or exceed widely regarded warning thresholds. Chronic budget and funding problems regionwide, including massive infrastructure investment needs and rising social spending pressures, will lead to greater reliance on foreign borrowing. That will contribute to debt accumulation and rising debt‐servicing burdens. Economic slowdown, massive banking and financial sector restructuring, erosion of export competitiveness and declining foreign exchange reserves will increase the likelihood that these countries will be unable to fully meet their foreign debt‐servicing obligations. The risk of debt default will be greatly increased over the next decade. Mounting public criticism will make it tougher to arrange future international financial rescue packages, such as those extended to Mexico and Thailand, for cash‐strapped sovereigns. As Canada’s economic profile rises in emerging markets, greater monitoring of country risks is warranted.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Market segmentation is widely regarded as a panacea for a variety of marketing ailments. Yet research in the financial services market highlights a number of significant barriers to the implementation of segmentation schemes. These barriers range from weaknesses in customer data and inappropriate organisational structure, to lack of marketing orientation and difficulties in obtaining a fit within the existing distribution structure. While the marketing literature acknowledges that these difficulties exist, there has been little formal analysis to capture the characteristics of these barriers. This problem is compounded by the considerable size and diversity of the sector which make it difficult to generalise about the implementation problems. This means that the extent of any barriers may vary in different areas of the financial services market and even in different organisations and that this variation may feasibly translate into different levels of segmentation usage. This research uses four short financial services case studies to examine the application of segmentation and consider the implementation barriers. Although the case studies cover a range of financial services companies, the analysis focuses on the provision of charge/credit cards by these organisations. The growth rate and increasing importance of the charge/credit card business make this a particularly pertinent area to analyse and allow a comparison with retail banking services more generally. The findings support the notion that a range of barriers to segmentation exists and shows how the importance of these barriers varies in different organisations.</jats:p>",

An increasing number of organizations from various industrial sectors have actively participated in implementing this new standard.

One of these directly supported the diamond mining operations, but it “back‐fired”, contaminating the surface with radionuclides such as caesium‐137, strontium‐90, plutonium‐239 and 240, and americium‐241. Furthermore, the low level of implementation of existing environmental legislation by the diamond mining company has resulted in contamination of the river systems which are the key sources of drinking water, and has significantly affected the health status of the population, which may have long‐lasting consequences, as there is increasing evidence of genetic abnormalities.

It was developed based on the analysis of regional hydrogeology, water use and land use. A calibrated groundwater flow model was incorporated into the optimisation models through a water head response matrix of the Quaternary aquifer. The current supply optimisation not only met the increasingly growing need of water demand but also controlled and eliminated the various hazards caused by groundwater over‐pumping. Artificial recharge management, with conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater, provided a practical solution to the overall groundwater exhaustion and led to a solution for water table recovery, aquifer protection and sustainable water use.

Three series of experiments were performed in a column test apparatus using two different soils to represent actual field conditions, namely, a fine gravel and a medium‐to‐fine Ottawa sand (both obtained from sources near Chicago, Illinois, USA) contaminated with toluene, a major constituent of petroleum products. The results showed that toluene was removed from gravel very efficiently using air sparging; complete removal was achieved using a variety of air flow rates. However the toluene removal rates in tests using sand were significantly less. Even at the highest air flow rate used during testing, complete toluene removal took eight times longer than in comparable tests using gravel. With low air flow rates this was not achieved even after 17 hours of testing. It was further found that the injection of foams generated with surfactants, SDS and witconol SN70, at low air flow rates during the use of air sparging was found to accelerate the bulk removal of toluene in sand, but the use of surfactants did not facilitate the removal of residual levels of contamination.</jats:p>",

The sensitivity of the interior model domain to the lateral boundaries is analyzed by comparing the base run with a model run with lateral boundary concentrations updated at six‐hour intervals. In the boundary layer over Europe, differences between the two runs are small both for accumulated excesses and for concentrations on individual days, indicating that ozone levels here are determined predominantly by local European scale sources. in the free troposphere, however, the effects of the lateral boundary concentrations are shown to be significant.</jats:p>",

LCA has been used to analyze the desirability of replacing lead (Pb) with a composite of tungsten (W) and tin (Sn) in projectile slugs used in small arms ammunition at US Department of Energy (DOE) training facilities for security personnel. The analysis includes consideration of costs, performance, environmental and human health impacts, availability of raw materials, and stakeholder acceptance. Projectiles developed by researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) using a composite of tungsten and tin are shown to perform as well as, or better than, those fabricated using lead. A cost analysis shows that tungsten‐tin is less costly to use than lead, since, for the current number of rounds used annually, the higher tungsten‐tin purchase price is small compared with higher maintenance costs associated with lead. The tungsten‐tin composite presents a much smaller potential for adverse human health and environmental impacts than lead. Only a small fraction of the world’s tungsten production occurs in the USA, however, and market‐economy countries account for only around 15 per cent of world tungsten production. Concludes that stakeholders would prefer tungsten‐tin on the basis of total cost, performance, reduced environmental impact and lower human toxicity. However, lead is preferable on the basis of material availability. Life cycle analysis clearly shows that advantages outweigh disadvantages in replacing lead with tungsten‐tin in small‐caliber projectiles at DOE training facilities. Concerns about the availability of raw tungsten are mitigated by the ease of converting back to lead (if necessary) and the recyclability of tungsten‐tin rounds.</jats:p>",

It is an indicator of business commitment to environmental improvement to the extent that the disclosures report progress in implementing environmental programmes. Perhaps more important, disclosure is a source of documentary evidence that can be used by external parties to evaluate company performance. The willingness by company managers to open the organisation to external scrutiny is often viewed as a necessary first step in obtaining business commitment to environmentally sustainable forms of business activity. This paper compares Western experience with environmental disclosure to that in Singapore. Information on environmental disclosure in Singapore is presented from a review of company annual reports (covering two years 1995/96 and 1996/97) and the responses to a questionnaire survey covering all public listed companies in Singapore. The surveys reveal a low commitment to environmental disclosure amongst Singapore organisations. Reasons for the low interest in disclosure are explained. Possible public policy responses and options for changing current business attitudes toward disclosure are outlined.</jats:p>",

While these two hypotheses are exceedingly important, the existing literature contains no empirical evidence supporting them. A field test of how effectively small business organizations are identifying strategic problems and opportunities, how effectively they implement business changes, and use IS technology to do so, was undertaken to empirically test their relationships. Despite the relatively small sample size, the results provide clear evidence about the importance of competitive intelligence and IS support for effectively implementing change in small business organizations. The items used for measuring the main constructs provide further insights into how managers should go about acquiring competitive intelligence and managing IS technology to effectively support business improvements.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Much research has recently been conducted into the use of models for the economic design of multiple control charts (EDCC). Control chart models generally assume that most process variables are constant and only a limited number of the major variables are varied to reach a local optimum. In the economic design of multiple control charts (EDMCC), multiple control charts are used to analyse many manufacturing process variables simultaneously, in order to produce an optimal design for process control. However, the large number of variables often makes it difficult to solve this optimisation problem manually. This research explores the proposition that EDMCC can be optimised by using a novel genetic algorithm which dynamically adjusts the genetic algorithm’s (GA) operator and parameter settings during operation to ensure optimum effectiveness. This method involves refining the chromosome structure and using orthogonal arrays with fuzzy reasoning to reduce the search space.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Notes that, until now, to route robotics travel, most investigations have utilized the fixed coordinate of placement points and magazine of the traveling salesman problem (TSP) method to sequence the placement points after the magazine has been arbitrarily assigned. Points out that, in fact, robotics travel routing should be based on a relative coordinate because the robotics, board and magazine simultaneously move at different speeds during assembly. Consequently, the coordinates of placement point and magazine are constantly changing. In this study, a novel tabu search (TS) based approach is presented. The proposed approach can arrange the placement sequence and assign the magazine slots to yield a performance better than the conventional one. Results presented herein also demonstrate that the larger the number of placement points and/or part numbers, the better the performance.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Recent research has focused on identifying the role of technology in strategic manufacturing decision making in a particular industry, in this case the Australian wine industry. This industry was chosen because it has a major focus on the use of advanced process technology as part of its manufacturing competitive positioning. In particular, technology is used to maximise product quality and reduce production costs. Technology was identified as the most important area of manufacturing process decision making, followed by quality assurance and control. It was also found that quality is the most important competitive priority for wine producers, followed by product cost. Both of these were found to be directly influenced by process technology. The competitive priority of rate of innovation, although also likely to be influenced by technology, was found to be much less important. Integration of technology with the process was also identified as being a much less important decision area. An ANOVA determined that there were 32 categories of wine producers for which there were significant differences in the importance of technology.</jats:p>",

Following a brief account of the changing structure of US food retailing, we present an analysis of its geographical dimensions, focusing on a discussion of possible opportunities for future growth in the US market.</jats:p>",

For the most part they are speculative, visionary or promotional. This work seeks to redress the balance by focusing on the utilisation of the Internet within the UK retail sector and examining its potential as a new retail channel. The paper presents an exploratory study using qualitative and quantitative methods: an on‐line survey of retail Web activities followed by in‐depth interviews. This approach provides a framework of current retail usage of the Internet and explores retailers’ perceptions of the inhibitors and facilitators to its development. It concludes with an emerging model that explains why current levels of retailing on the Internet are low and provides guidance for retailers wishing to increase their level of Internet activity.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Centrally‐planned economies generally put little emphasis on the retail sector. The communist government in Poland, for example, worked with an “economy of shortages”, where demand for most goods was greater than supply and there was no incentive to develop an efficient distribution system. However, in 1989 the Polish government introduced a free market economy. Deregulation and liberalisation of trade allowed retailers to play a leading role in the subsequent changes, and make a major contribution to economic growth. The transformation of this sector needed a new approach to organisation, operations and ownership. This paper describes some of the changes in the Polish retail sector during a period of radical change.</jats:p>",

The strength of these matrix‐based techniques lies in their ability to integrate the many qualitative and quantitative‐based variables that impact the supply chain. From the matrix, a meaningful and coherent strategy for improvement can be determined. The approach is appealing in its simplicity and yet rigorous at the same time, and, as such, may be of use to practitioners in any complex environment such as a supply chain.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Business process re‐engineering (BPR) promises to transform organizations by fundamentally altering their core processes, thereby achieving radical improvements in performance. As the number of actual re‐engineering projects increases, the rhetoric surrounding BPR has shifted to reflect greater cynicism and discomfort over its claims. In the absence of compelling and trustworthy evidence about the success of BPR projects, critics have exposed logical contradictions within BPR’s “manifesto” for revolutionary change and insinuated that BPR’s utopian rhetoric masks political motives. This paper contributes to this discussion in three ways. First we examine two difficulties affecting the evaluation of BPR programmes: defining what process re‐engineering really is, and determining whether BPR has been applied successfully. Second, we examine four fundamental contradictions inherent in BPR’s analysis of organizations: the fallacy of its “clean‐slate” assumption, the paradox of information technology’s role as an enabler of organizational change, the hypocrisy of employee empowerment, and the irony of employee commitment. Third we propose that such contradictions be addressed in both research and practice by employing theoretical perspectives that are prepared to accommodate contradictory phenomena, in contrast to the simplistic, deterministic logic guiding current investigations of BPR’s effectiveness. We suggest theories of organizational learning and organizational politics to understand and resolve the contradictions embedded within BPR.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, computer‐aided software engineering tools (CASE) have emerged to provide automation support to the software development process. Such automation is a revolutionary progress which promises dramatic improvement in software quality and productivity. However, despite such promises, CASE tools have not proved to be effective in some organizations owing to the fact that far fewer efforts are expended by organizations on evaluation for selection and introduction of appropriate CASE tools. Proposes a conceptual model on CASE environment that is assembled from two distinct but related processes : “CASE selection” and “CASE adoption”. Further argues that CASE adoption process will be affected if an organization fails to select appropriate CASE tools. Therefore, the success of CASE adoption is very much dependent on the process of CASE selection. Moreover, there is also a possibility that even a suitable CASE tool may not contribute positively, if it is not adopted systematically. Thus, if the CASE adoption fails then a CASE environment would not function. Against this background, cites two case studies describing the experiences of two organizations that adopted a particular brand of front‐end CASE tool. One organization was successful in introducing the tool, and experienced considerable improvement in quality and productivity. Conversely, the same CASE tool failed to achieve its purpose in another organization. In the light of the model, further describes why and how CASE failed in one organization, and was considered successful in another. Finally, also highlights the lessons learned from their experiences.</jats:p>",

It has identified that the training and support on offer to the rural operator tend to be parochial, fragmented and unco‐ordinated. The research was instigated by Birmingham College of Food, Tourism and Creative Studies, a specialist in the provision of hospitality and tourism studies and ultimately aims at the development and implementation of a co‐ordinated training programme for this sector. By pointing up the poor quality of such provision in an essentially central location, the paper invites the questions: how much worse the situation must be in truly peripheral locations, and what action can be taken to improve the situation.</jats:p>",

Investigates the influence and effects of the national culture in the People’s Republic of China on the work environment and the employees of international hotel companies operating there. Uses the ITT Sheraton Corporation’s Great Wall Sheraton Hotel as a specific case study, but draws on other research conducted in similar joint venture hotel properties. Sutton (1995) demonstrates that hospitality operations in China are predominantly occidental, while both the labour force and the prevalent customer base are overwhelmingly oriental. Ahmed and Li (1996) argue that when different national and organisational cultural values come into contact, conflict tends to emerge. Evidence from both their researches suggests that the “marriage” between Chinese and Western organisations tends to precipitate numerous conflicts. Identifies and illustrates several aspects of Chinese culture which affect the assimilation of a “foreign” corporate culture, and concludes that a strong national culture can have major influences on what happens in the workplace.</jats:p>",

In the hotel industry, researchers have recently devoted attention to the application of neural networks to the classification of tourist segments and the prediction of visitor behaviour. However, no previous attempt has been made to incorporate neural networks into hotel occupancy rate forecasting. This paper reports on a study about applying neural networks to the forecasting of room occupancy rates. The significance of this approach was tested with actual data from the Hong Kong hotel industry. Estimated room occupancy rates were compared with actual room occupancy rates. Experimental results indicate that using neural networks to forecast room occupancy rates outperforms multiple regression and naïve extrapolation, two commonly used forecasting approaches.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In an effort to understand the base differences between tourism and hospitality academic programmes, it is important to understand their philosophical relationships. Different types of philosophies will give rise to different orientations. The differential orientations often lead to conflicts. These conflicts are not usually understood in terms of basic philosophical differences, but are seen as a perceptual distinction. This translates to the real world in that many tourism and hospitality professionals have strong feelings about each other that lead to professional misunderstandings. These differences in philosophy also have important ramifications for curricula, course structure, or the instructional philosophies. The purpose of this article is to examine the philosophical relationships between tourism and hospitality academic programmes and their implications, especially for curricular design. This type of philosophical modelling will help obtain a better perspective on the design of courses that have a general thematic structure to improve the preparations programmes in tourism and hospitality.</jats:p>",

In particular, the supply and stocking systems for new vehicles have been subject to greater change since 1992 than at any time in the past and, it must be emphasized, this change is still ongoing. There has been very little academic research on distribution generally and some of the points drawn from this work in the automotive industry may have viability in other contexts with suitable localization. Summarizes the research carried out in the UK by the International Car Distribution Programme. Shows that some franchises have instituted revolutionary changes while others are more evolutionary. Some would seem to have carefully considered philosophies and strategies while others appear to have more of a “me‐too” approach. Many franchises have introduced central‐stocking systems as the first step in trying to make their supply systems leaner and they have achieved both an increase in customer matching (customers actually getting the exact specification of car that they wanted) and a decrease in stock and costs. Those already operating such systems are making them more sophisticated as time goes on. During the fieldwork for the research some systems had received major updates and others were due to occur in early 1995. There are many different approaches and in the research they have been classified into broadly similar types. The systems operated by some franchises are already pan‐European while others are confined to the UK with continental markets operating traditionally. In addition, wholly new approaches and systems are in the process of being introduced ‐ such as one specialist manufacturer who has introduced a “supply to order” policy. The improvements in distribution efficiency have the potential to provide savings typically of about £150 (but up to £360) per new car sold to the franchise as a whole. In addition there are unquantified benefits from the considerable improvements in customer satisfaction. Part of such savings can be realized by the dealer and part by the manufacturer. Some franchises had already realized large proportions of these savings and benefits before this research took place while others still have opportunities ahead of them and could yet achieve the sort of amounts suggested above.</jats:p>",

Tower cranes still dominate for high rise in‐situ concrete buildings, although contractors will also frequently utilise concrete pumps in conjunction. Company size has little impact on the materials handling method selected. Eight predominant (construction method) selection factors are identified, and ranked for each international group of contractors. Statistically, the rankings are shown to be almost the same for each country. Relative costs, speed of construction, and site safety are the principal selection criteria. Correlation analysis reveals a degree of association between the selection factors.</jats:p>",

This paper addresses a lingering issue of integrating different internal management systems for synergy purposes. Benefits of developing and integrating management systems are illustrated, followed by a discussion of the system concept in a service context. System dynamics is used to illustrate interrelationships of objectives, resources and processes as main elements of service management systems. Subsequently, a systems approach was applied to restructure the ISO 9001 and ISO 9004‐2 quality assurance/management guidelines for services, as well as ISO 14001/ISO 14004 environmental management standards. Such restructured management systems can then be connected to form an integrated management system, together with ergonomics, financial, health, safety and other systems. Finally, examples of three service organizations that used a systems approach to integrate existing internal management systems are illustrated.</jats:p>",

The coarse grid showed to have significant numerical noise in the objective function while the finer grid had less numerical noise. The optimisation was performed with two methods, a Response Surface Model (RSM) and a gradient‐based method (the Method of Feasible Directions) to study the influence from numerical noise. Both optimisation methods were able to find the global optimum with the two different grid sizes (the search path for the gradient‐based method on the coarse grid was able to avoid the region in the design space containing local minima). However, the RSM needed fewer iterations in reaching the optimum.

The article asserts that women’s access to the labour market has been slow and more difficult compared with other European countries. It shows how women have had to adapt to male behavioural patterns in order to penetrate the labour market. Education has played a fundamental role in increasing female participation and the service sector has provided the largest number of job opportunities. The extreme rigidity of the Italian labour market limits the use of part‐time work and other flexible working arrangements. In addition, gender stereotypes, still deeply rooted in Italian society, are responsible for a postponement of a “new labour force creation” and for the under‐representation of women in managerial positions and high level jobs.</jats:p>",

Moreover, female retail managers were more likely than their male counterparts to suffer from additional pressures caused by sex discrimination and prejudice. The outcome of these stressors can contribute to organisational deficiency, ultimately damaging the reputation of the company.

Analysis revealed that, although only minimal stereotyping of women as managers was openly expressed by senior managers, few measures for the deliberate inclusion and advancement of women into management were identified. Mauritius represents a developmental paradox, being somewhat isolated from the “highly industrialised” world and its advancements in equal opportunity and positive action movements, but also from less developed countries’ close and long‐term associations with aid agencies, which largely include gender mainstreaming programmes. The survey uncovered politically correct women‐manager‐friendly responses in corporate Mauritius, but practically no affirmative action of any sort. Implications include the consideration of the presence of “helpful” agencies in newly industrialising countries, and for a radical increase in multilateral interactions, lest such successful small economies be transformed into victims of their own success.</jats:p>",

One method FEMA has used to support State and local emergency communication functions was to sign and implement a Memorandum of Understanding with the American Radio Relay League (ARRL) for amateur radio operators to provide electronic communications for State and local governments in disasters. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has licensed more than 600,000 amateur radio operators in the USA. The national organization of amateur radio operators called the American Radio Relay League (ARRL) was formed in 1914. More than 80,000 of these amateurs have registered their availability for emergency communications in disasters in the ARRL’s Amateur Radio Emergency Service (ARES). Amateur radio operators have been providing communications in natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes and earthquakes since 1910. Since amateur radio operation was prohibited during the years of both World Wars I and II, FEMA has sponsored a new branch of the amateur service called Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service (RACES). RACES operators are authorized to operate if the President invokes his War Emergency Powers while all other amateur operation would be silenced. Examines the role of amateur radio in providing emergency electronic communications for disaster management and explores future contributions.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Malaysia is an ex‐colonial, newly‐industrialising country, with a sustained high economic growth rate averaging eight per cent GDP per annum over the past ten years. Within such a rapidly booming economy, the pace of social, economic and political change is fast, as is the pace of technological change. Other things being equal, these are the changes in which environmental hazards can be magnified. As a result of rapid economic development, physical systems are disturbed and changed. For example, the modification of the hydrological cycle due to deforestation, urbanisation, development of hill slopes and other human land use have given rise to increased risks of landslides. In recent years, the collapse of a block of luxury condominiums in Kuala Lumpur, the Genting Highland and Pos Dipang landslide tragedies as well as other landslide disasters have caused substantial loss of life and damage to property and infrastructure. Combined with intensive development of hill slopes and hill land for housing, recreation, tourism, agriculture, highway and dam construction, and other human induced land use changes, the exposure and vulnerability of human populations to landslide hazards have also increased. Other reasons, largely structural, such as persistent poverty, low residential and occupational mobility, and landlessness, manifested in illegal squatting and farming on hill slopes and foothills have also contributed to increased vulnerability of large communities to landslide hazards in many parts of the country. As Malaysia pushes ahead to meet its target of becoming a fully industrialised country by the year 2020, further environmental degradation is expected to occur. Notwithstanding other aspects of environmental degradation, the occurrence of landslide hazards is expected to become a common feature of Malaysian life.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>A growing literature is now claiming that participation in the arts, and music in particular, is beneficial to health. Whilst some claims are made for music benefiting physiological health, the main benefit would seem to be for gains in emotional wellbeing. There is a gender dimension to participation in music, with girls being more likely to participate, and boys who wish to sing or play certain instruments facing the disapproval of a “macho” peer culture. The paper reports on qualitative research carried out into the views of 18 boy singers in a well‐known church choir in England, using observation, diary keeping, individual and group interviews. The boys showed a deep appreciation of and engagement with the music. They exhibited many features of high personal wellbeing, including the social competence to circumscribe the proscriptions of “macho” culture. Those from state schools were very critical of the superficial way singing was tackled in their schools. Secondary schools were reported as being more accepting of their singing than primary schools. All the boys were academic high achievers and were particularly keen on autonomous reading, again being critical of the guided reading offered by their schools. The paper concludes that state schools could do more to involve young people, including boys, in singing, and to take the subject more seriously, but acknowledges that the pressures on state schools to deliver literacy and numeracy are making this difficult.</jats:p>",

In recent times the main focus for debate has been the impact of tobacco <jats:italic>advertising</jats:italic> on under‐age smoking. However, with the proposed ban on tobacco advertising, this paper argues that <jats:italic>branding</jats:italic> may prove pivotal to re‐orienting thinking about how tobacco marketing continues to influence smoking initiation. Marketing theory asserts that creating demand for a product is dependent upon building a strong brand identity that concurs with the needs, values and lifestyles of the consumer. It is hypothesised that branding can function by affecting not only the way people perceive specific tobacco products but also their perceptions of smoking behaviour itself. Using branding to extend the debate in this way provides some useful insights into the role tobacco marketing might play in encouraging young people to start smoking. It is concluded that explanations for smoking initiation can be found, not by attempting to isolate the abilities of tobacco marketing and health policy to persuade young people to adopt one behaviour in favour of the other, but by examining how exposure to competing forces such as these during adolescence may conspire to brand smoking in a way that encourages young people to experiment with cigarettes. It is suggested that more significant advances in reducing smoking rates are likely to depend upon a willingness to confront the fundamental contradictions that are created by such competing forces.</jats:p>",

Osteoporosis or “brittle bone disease” is fast becoming a public health matter. To prevent this crippling disease, it has been suggested that it would be beneficial to increase awareness of it through health promotion, specifically that aimed at teenage girls. This study, therefore, investigated what 16‐year‐old girls knew about osteoporosis and related issues. A structured, multiple choice questionnaire was disseminated to five schools within the Borough of Wolverhampton. The questionnaire consisted of 24 questions covering areas relating to general knowledge of osteoporosis, physiology, diet (calcium and vitamin D) and exercise. Two hundred questionnaires were distributed and 119 completed questionnaires were returned. The mean score out of 24 was 9.83; with a standard deviation of 3.39. The results show that knowledge of osteoporosis among teenage girls is poor. Concludes that it is necessary to raise awareness of the issues surrounding osteoporosis, especially in relation to diet and exercise, in this age group.</jats:p>",

It seeks to establish a revitalised agenda for research into the health and wellbeing of children and young people in the UK. The article describes how contemporary sociological understandings of children and childhood have implications not only for the way in which health and health promotion strategies are conceived, designed and implemented, but for our understanding of what health and health promotion initiatives should constitute. The article calls for more research into children’s and young people’s understandings of health, and the linguistic idioms in which those understandings are expressed, as well as into the social networks and social action spaces in which children and young people operate. It argues for better integration of research and policies concerning the health of children and young people, to include institutions, agencies and organisations that have an impact on the health of children and young people.</jats:p>",

With the slow demise of the GDR economy, which had been noticeable since the beginning of the 1980s, general conditions of library training worsened. The fall of the GDR was therefore a release and traditional library training could be rescued.

Aims to propose a framework of teacher self‐management and draw implications for teacher training. Teacher self‐management is a continuous process comprising two self‐propelling cycles. The major cycle consists of five sequential stages, in which teachers as strategic actors will be aware of the changing education environment and able to readjust their personal goals and action plans to meet emerging challenges. The support cycle facilitates action learning in various stages of the major cycle. Practising in the major and support cycles, teachers may develop the necessary self‐renewal and competence for ensuring the quality of their professional work in the changing environment. From this conception of self‐management, the traditional staff development practice in school can be re‐engineered to maximize opportunities for facilitating teachers’ self‐management and self‐learning. For both pre‐service and in‐service teacher training, the self‐management theory can also bring alternative ideas for reforming teacher education programmes and preparing teachers for quality performance in a changing education environment. The implications should be useful not only to educational organizations but also to other professional organizations.</jats:p>",

While postal services and public utilities share similar peak‐load problems as discussed in the traditional natural monopoly literature, limited deferrability of mail service, together with service differentiated pricing, yields a framework sufficiently different so as to warrant a separate analysis.

An action research based approach was used to explore the nature and issues associated with fostering the dynamic learning capability within the firm.

It is argued that enabling actionable knowledge creation is a fragile process that has to be managed with care, and is far more complex than the literature suggests.</jats:p>",

These stories are seen as “stories within a story”. Organizational stories are governed by a dominant myth that bounds and constrains the context and content of the organizational learning. Argues that myths are founded in paradox. Story types that challenge the myth (parable above all) surface the assumptions underlying the paradox, leading to a higher level of learning or consciousness and, ultimately, a new myth. Examines the dominant business myth within recent (post‐1984) New Zealand experience, a period of radical restructuring, called internationally “The New Zealand Experiment”. From this repetoire of stories, several parables are chosen which demonstrate the role of parable in perplexing paradox, thereby generating new and surprising learning. Suggests that there exist “peoples of paradox”, communities of place and practice, operating out of alternate myths, with the capacity to enlarge the learning/consciousness space, and to develop higher levels of learning, or “third‐loop learning”. The challenge for organizational learning and research is to integrate insights from the study of narrative and organizational learning to better understand how this higher consciousness can be fostered. This is the territory in which the quantum leaps for business will take place.</jats:p>",

Although some of these principles may be at the back of their minds, many managers today are awash with complicated modern management concepts, so much so that the simple but yet time‐tested wisdom enunciated in the Holy Bible is conveniently brushed aside or overlooked.

QMS2000, a technology‐based enterprise‐wide assessment model, is a relational, interactive information system that includes data from 313 satisfaction surveys that are linked to corresponding databases at the University. QMS2000 is an on‐line information system, operating in a networked, client‐server environment that permits licensed users access to designated components of the system. QMS2000 users generate reports and perform advanced statistical analyses drawing from the QMS2000 databases. The data and reports are used to improve academic and support programs at the university. The role of QMS2000 in the University’s quality improvement scheme and its initial impact are discussed.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>College and university technology administrators and faculty face an interesting scenario of technology supply and demand. On one hand, the promise of technology for enhanced learning has created a demand from faculty to be provided with cutting‐edge hardware, software, and training aimed at technology implementation into their curriculum. However, education, economy and businesses’ need for technically‐savvy scholars and workers has meant an increase in the supply of students returning to receive education in technology‐related fields. We argue that merging these two in advanced technology courses solves an institute’s need for software and training; it also provides incoming students with an authentic learning environment for appreciating the complex domain of technological tools in education. The creation, development, and implementation of the Physical Science Activity Database is provided to demonstrate that, although this idea is not necessarily new, using Web and database networks enables widespread reusability as well as complexity of learning.</jats:p>",

After the behaviors were identified, applied behavior analysis was used to reinforce the desired behaviors. By focusing on behaviors which built trust and encouraged open communications, the team was able to take advantage of the diverse experience and backgrounds of all team members.

The company helpdesk system was employed to provide detail of the frequency and nature of the PC component failure and the time taken for the repairs.

It was found that for most PC components there is a higher probability of failure, leading to a higher cost of unreliability, in the early part of life. The conclusion is drawn that bulk purchase of PCs will lead to higher running costs in the initial period and for many organisations a rolling replacement policy would spread costs more evenly. The helpdesk was found to be an excellent source of information for improving the quality of maintenance procedures.</jats:p>",

In fact, the optimal software release problem based on some software reliability growth models has been studied by many authors. In this paper, we propose a new method to estimate the optimal software release time under an alternative cost criterion. More precisely, two kinds of artificial neural networks are used to estimate the fault‐detection time observed in both testing and operation phases. As a cost criterion, we adopt the expected cost rate (the expected total software cost per unit testing time). Then, it is shown that the optimization problem to obtain the optimal release time can be reduced to a graphical one to minimize the tangent slope from a point to an (estimated) empirical curve in two‐dimensional space. Through numerical examples using actual fault‐detection time data, it is illustrated that the method proposed is a very useful device to estimate the optimal software release time precisely.</jats:p>",

In order to maintain thinner layer thickness and model accuracy, a cutter is employed to plane off the deposited surface. The fabrication speed for MM models is extremely low because of the employment of the tiny jet and the cutting operation. The model interior filling does not affect the model accuracy very much but it does significantly affect the fabrication speed.

The resin compositions are based on cycloaliphatic esters and proprietary epoxies, which possess excellent thermal and electrical stability. The key features of these materials are short cure cycle, long‐term stability at 25°C, very low cure volatile, low moisture absorption, low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), and excellent adhesion to various substrates. In addition, the change in CTE below and above the glass transition temperature of the polymers is minimal. This unique behaviour is attributed to the interpenetrating network‐like (IPN) structure of the base resin composition. Further evidence of the IPN structure is the broad loss modulus and tan δ observed between −150°C and +150°C in dynamic mechanical tests. The extensive curing reaction yields a high crosslink density polymer network, resulting in good moisture resistance (&lt;0.2% after 14 days in 85°C/85%RH) and thermal stability (&lt;0.3 wt % at 300 °C of the cured material). The extent of cure has been studied in a dynamic scanning calorimeter (DSC) by following the extent of post‐cure exotherm. Both in the accelerated and non‐accelerated systems, the curing is complete in a single step with no post curing required. Cure cycles used range from 1 hour at 140°C to about 1 minute at 170°C. Currently, cure stresses, fracture toughness (bulk and interfacial), fatigue life, and various reliability tests are being performed to characterise the underfill, glob top encapsulants, and die‐attach adhesives.</jats:p>",

Describes the development and costing of a model of QFD implementation issues, product development outcomes, and customer satisfaction. Concludes that QFD’s implementation issues, specifically the organizational dimensions, have a significant impact on product design outcomes and resource consumption.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>For over a decade, total quality management has been a principle focus of business managers and academic researchers alike. The myriad prescriptions and practices, all purporting to represent this management philosophy, have been implemented with varying degrees of success. Despite the significant failure rate of TQM programs, the successes, as indicated by Baldrige Award winners, support continued interest in TQM. The search for linkages between current descriptive models and proposed prescriptive models of TQM spawned our research, which, in turn, required creation of a survey instrument. This paper describes the initial sources and development of this instrument, the rigorous sequence of testing that it has been subjected to, and its application for current and future research. The successful achievement of key survey statistics suggests that this instrument can be used for TQM data collection with confidence by researchers elsewhere who will investigate other proposed models.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The value of winning the Baldrige Quality Award to the shareholders of the firm has been the subject of a debate motivated by bipolar perceptions and an opposing set of viewpoints held by both industry leaders and academic professionals. One of the key concerns that must be addressed to place the impact of the Baldrige Award in a proper perspective (and thus contribute to the resolution of this debate on the issue of the value to the shareholders of the winning firms) is the short‐term negative effect imputed by the views and the actions of the critics, especially the short sellers who see the announcement of the award as an opportunity to make profits by short selling the stock. In this study, we focus on this concern and examine the short‐term impact of the Baldrige Award announcement on the shareholder wealth by applying a rigorous statistical methodology to analyze the stock price movements around the day of the announcement of the award for statistically significant abnormal behavior. Our analysis falsifies the critics’ claim that the financial and other resources spent by the companies toward winning the Baldrige Award are wasteful and reduce shareholder wealth. </jats:p>",

The RBE has evolved over several decades and now has an accepted standard format. The RBE also serves as an introduction to control charts which are an important tool in statistical quality control. Surprisingly very little is known about the statistical properties of the RBE. This is most likely due to the fact that the RBE involves mechanical sampling and so is much more complicated than probability sampling. New methods are given for statistical analysis when mechanical sampling is involved (e.g. mechanical sampling of non‐uniform output in a manufacturing environment). This approach has specific applications to control charts which are a major tool in quality control. In a rigorous analysis, it is shown that <jats:italic>p</jats:italic>, the sample proportion of red beads in the RBE, is an unbiased estimator of the RBE process defect rate. Expressions are also found for the variance of <jats:italic>p</jats:italic>, enabling the calculation of control chart limits.

It is argued that UK supermarkets are delivering a quite different offering to the marketplace from a simple “basket of goods” with a specific price and quality. The issues of product range, innovation potential, and associated convenience factors are all part of the package. This leads to a consideration of the questions of “What is competing with what?” and “Who is competing with whom?”: the issue of comparing like with like.

Among several initiatives in the US textiles industry to deal with the problem, one in particular aims to achieve quick response (QR) in the supply chain through accurate response (AR). AR is an approach to forecasting, planning, and production that builds on QR capabilities within the supply chain organisation. In order to achieve this, a total systems perspective is necessary requiring analysis of activities. This paper describes a formal system analysis methodology utilising design principles that builds on activities, and utilises models that achieve synchronisation through waste management in inventory for a textile garment supply chain. The generic features of this activity‐based problem representation methodology hold promise for its common application across supplier/consumer class of system problems.</jats:p>",

The number of firms decreased substantially while production levels increased. The process of restructuring was triggered by a combination of shifting consumer demands, internationalisation of markets, and concentration among food retailers. Many potato firms were unable to adjust to these developments and found themselves either for sale or bankrupt. Others engaged in mergers or strategic alliances to meet the changing demands. The resulting concentration process led to higher levels of both vertical and horizontal interdependence between the remaining firms. The rules of competition have changed: opposed to competing individually, successful potato firms achieve substantial competitive advantages through co‐operative inter‐firm arrangements that gain access to high‐quality raw materials, production capacity, and large customers. Consequently, managing inter‐firm co‐operation has become a strategic issue for firms in the potato supply chain.</jats:p>",

A body measurement system developed by the Textile Clothing Technology Corporation was used to acquire two scans from each of 72 subjects. The subjects were instructed to continue to breathe normally and stand with their feet shoulder‐width apart. The two scans were compared and statistical analysis was performed to determine the precision of the results and whether this lack of standardization affected the data. Physical measurements were also obtained from each subject and served as a basis for comparison to the scanned measurements. Since physical measurements are the current accepted “true value”, these measurements determined the level of accuracy of scanned data. Three separate scans of 72 different subjects were taken at various levels of breathing and at various foot positions to determine the effect of the variables. This study certainly indicates that respiration and foot placement has a significant effect on body scan data. It was established that the scan data rendered by the software does have precision, but lacks accuracy when compared against physical measurements. This may be owing to the inaccuracies of the physical measurement process or to differences in measurement location between the anthropometrist and the 3D measurement extraction software. Information detailing the level of accuracy and precision that can be obtained with scanning software and how respiration and subject positioning can affect the data are included.</jats:p>",

It is also the resource which is most difficult to maintain, for the ongoing war for talent depletes the human capital of companies that fail to meet their employee expectations. To increase employee satisfaction and retention, corporations are eliminating the restrictions on internal employee mobility. Free internal labor markets (ILMs) demonstrate to employees that they can realize their career goals within rather than outside of the company. The liberalization of internal mobility and the institutionalization of job competition cause the convergence of the ILM and the external labor market. The transition to ILM is challenging but is the only road to securing long‐term competitive advantage.

One of the major reasons for its success is that it has relatively good predictive validity. However, ACs are not without problems. Despite their relatively good predictive validity, research has been unable to show adequately their content validity, and construct validity has not been demonstrated. It is for this reason that the need for and analysis of the development assessment centre (DAC) is being presented. A DAC needs to be seen as the start point ‐ not end point ‐ of development. However, the evolution of the ACs towards DACs remains too new to generalize on their impact on job performance although some related research is promising. This article examines AC characteristics and AC criteria such as: effectiveness requirements; validity; cost effectiveness and outcomes (descriptive or prescriptive). The gap between the AC and the DAC is examined in terms of design applications. DACs by having the combination of a clear and precise feedback and a pragmatic on‐the‐job follow‐up of what was learned in the simulations, can be a powerful instrument in enhancing the competencies of a business organization and its employees in terms of reliable and accelerated development within a dynamic and turbulent environment.</jats:p>",

Data reveal that the transition of police departments from a traditional reactive philosophy to one of community policing is an evolving process.

By facilitating a process by which workplace learning is conceptualized and placed in an academic context, action learning based qualifications are well suited to provide a link between academic knowledge of core managerial disciplines and the context within which such skills are demonstrated. This paper outlines a credit mapping approach developed by the IMC Association which enables workplace and professional development courses to form the basis of certificated awards at the Action Learning Certificate in Management Studies (Action Learning CMS) level. The strength of the approach is that it addresses the demand for adaptive and responsive adult educational provision which is not restricted by the site of learning or the age or circumstances of the student. An important caveat is that the rules and guidance by which credit can be accumulated and transferred are vitally important in order to facilitate understanding of the process, coherent patterns of study for students and to safeguard academic standards. The process of credit mapping and validating workplace learning has the potential to improve access to higher postgraduate awards and add value to both the consumer and supplier of workplace training courses.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Some of the conventions regarding relearning of complex tasks (requiring both psychomotor and procedural skills) are well known, especially as relating to retention curves. Still lacking, however, is information which better clarifies the relationship between relearning and skill retention. The purpose of this study was to examine this relationship while identifying the parameter affecting the duration between training intervals, in order to maintain a high level of performance. Two additional aspects were examined in this study: actual differences in the measure of decrease in the operator’s level for various task dimensions and the implication for integrating a simulator in the refresher training program. This study conducted a controlled field experiment in a military electronic warfare unit, examining refresher training of reserve soldiers operating a complex electronic system. Examination of the study’s hypotheses and analysis of the experiment’s results indicated a cyclical behavioral model of the retention curve and the relearning aspects involved (training intervals, “warming up” phenomenon, model boundaries etc.). This result necessitates the inclusion of the retention curve within the framework of the instruction task analysis (especially with training programs which include refresher training). It should be noted that the study’s conclusions are valid not merely for military tasks, but are also valid for implementation in complex civilian tasks.</jats:p>",

It notes that “Peter’s” drinking was apparently only ever tackled at a disciplinary level, never at a therapeutic/counselling one. Controversially, “Peter” contends that his former employer was (and remains) effectively indifferent to alcohol abuse among its workforce.

This article articulates and describes these trends based on discussions with over 200 companies concerning executive development over the last 18 months. These trends are: (1) processes to align executive development to the business objectives; (2) the parallel development of individuals and learning organisations; (3) the development of critical individual competencies; (4) the creation of a select but comprehensive menu of development options; (5) the development of global partnerships, networks and alliances; (6) the creation of competitive advantage through learning. These trends indicate a focus on developing organisational and individual capabilities aligned to the business objectives in order to create competitive advantage. This focus is not new, but the deliberate attempt to combine these six trends indicates a new awareness of how to achieve competitive advantage through learning.

A two‐stage methodology was used, with three companies being studied in‐depth and three as supplementary cases. The top‐down strategic planning mode, which dominates the manufacturing strategy literature, was found to be inadequate as a depiction of manufacturing strategy formation in SMEs in practice. Manufacturing strategy formation was shown to be a complex process involving a combination of deliberate and emergent actions and decisions, influenced by organisational culture, politics and powerful individuals. Emergent actions and decisions within manufacturing always played a part in manufacturing strategy formation. Manufacturing strategy formation could be more deliberate if greater use was made of business planning and by the identification of a set of explicit objectives for manufacturing. Manufacturing strategy formation could be less emergent if political behaviour could be reduced. Other factors that seemed to be influential included the interpretative processes of managers, the role of a corporate parent and the level of management education.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Macro change drivers like global competition, information and technology innovations, and demographic shifts have required organizations to rethink their structures and processes. In particular, the flattening and downsizing of organizations has led to the empowerment of teams in an attempt to increase flexibility, adaptability, customer responsiveness, and productiveness. While transition to teams has been a widely adopted strategy, there are many examples of team failures that eventually undermine empowerment. It is argued in this article that the formation of teams requires the presence of certain external and internal conditions. The external requisites include support and direction, such as congruence with strategy, top management support, clear goals and parameters, and effective selection of employees. The internal requisites include an emphasis on preparation and training of employees through initial team building and ongoing team development, and encouragement of a continual reflective learning cycle. Without the internal processes for team learning, even an initially successful team may defeat itself and become unproductive, thereby discouraging further support for team empowerment initiatives.</jats:p>",

Very little literature has appeared that brings together our current state of knowledge on performance targets and suitable methodologies. This paper attempts to compensate for this shortfall by first explaining the three major forms that targets assume and then presenting four methods that are useful when assessing performance in each case. The three forms are first, the target is a single lower limit; second, the target is a single upper limit; and third, the target is a zone between an upper and a lower limit. The four methods to calculate the level of improvement needed to reach target are the counting, distance, histogram and capability index methods. While individually each method cannot be claimed to be new, the contribution of this paper lies in their integration, which has not been presented in such a comprehensive way before.</jats:p>",

Baum and Crosby highlighted the inadequacy of\ncurrent dual rate valuation methods for leasehold investments and the\nproblems associated with the contemporary approach. Their work is used\nas the basis for this article. A discounted cash flow (DCF) approach is\ndeveloped using an analysis of target returns. The all risks yield (ARY)\nand target return are first assessed on the basis that the investment is\nfreehold but otherwise identical. The implied annual growth rate in CRV\nis then calculated using the equated yield formula. It is then argued,\nthat because this growth in CRV arises from the location and quality of\nthe building, it is equally applicable to a leasehold interest in that\nbuilding. This leaves only the target return for the leasehold interest\nto be established, for a DCF valuation to be possible. Market\ntransactions in leasehold properties are analysed in terms of target\nreturn to illustrate how statistical evidence of market sentiment can be\naccumulated. This evidence is based on the “extra return”\nrequired for leasehold investments over comparable freeholds.

The performance of an international portfolio would be strongly influenced by the changes seen in the exchange rate of the investor and in the country of their investments. Occupational costs meanwhile vary considerably as a function of currency movements as well as rental growth. A single currency would reduce this risk. The changing economic conditions necessary to deliver a single currency are however of greater importance than the denomination of money. Examines the general concept of a single currency, rather than the specific design and implementation of the Euro as currently envisaged. There are clearly some concerns as to the stability of the proposed new European currency. If extreme, these could outweigh the advantages indicated in this research, particularly over the shorter term. Modelling capital growth and yields demonstrates the importance of exchange rates as a function of monetary policy and economic behaviour. A single currency could allow yield premiums to fall in more volatile markets as economic conditions converge, as has already been seen in bond markets. It would highlight the pricing of property as a function of fundamental demand and income security and could facilitate a more sophisticated valuation and investment appraisal practice in Europe. If EMU goes ahead it will lead to new occupational patterns and areas of investment growth. As such it is likely to generate tenant and investor activity as the most efficient and competitive locations are sought out.</jats:p>",

This fact has been attributed mainly to the necessity of eliminating a higher degree of human resistance on the implementation of such a project. Our argument within this paper is that appropriate corporate communication would promote better chances to dissolve the aforementioned resistance. The research focused on large manufacturing enterprises and it brings to light the industrialists’ practices and expectances related to the communication issue and to the investment in IT to assist in the improvement of the information flow within and outside of the organisation. Based on the experience of the practitioners interviewed, a communication model was implemented aiming to guide companies in building their own communication process framework. Despite some important initiatives, the findings suggest that the improvement in the strategies of communication is not sufficient on its own but there are other key relational aspects to be considered in order to achieve the envisaged outcome.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Construction business performance measurement (BPM) is myopic, most often being project‐specific, profit‐orientated, and neglecting broader “stakeholder” issues. If construction organizations are to remain competitive in the longer term, they need to develop and better understand their relations with their customers, suppliers, employees, lenders and the wider community. Hence, performance measurement must embrace these broader business characteristics. The need for a shift in “orthodox” (BPM) beliefs from “basic” performance measurement, to an alternative “stakeholder perspective measurement” (SPM), is underlined. SPM will adequately consider relations with customers, suppliers, employees, financiers, and the wider community; all being critical for a business’s long‐term viability. The paper goes on to advocate that construction organizations should reject this myopic strategic thinking, and better consider the interests of their stakeholders, both economically and morally. The latter calls for development of a serious stakeholder perspective to business performance measurement, so that construction organizations can be monitored and judged in a socially acceptable manner.</jats:p>",

To accomplish these goals new technologies need to be investigated and adopted. Organizations are experiencing paradigm shifting that at times is bordering on paradigm pioneering. For a dramatic, innovative re‐engineering effort to be successfully implemented, change management is essential. While information technology has great potential for providing added value to products and services, business executives are frustrated because business processes and information technology are not synchronized. The inflexibility of older information systems and information technology (IS/IT) constrained growth and competitiveness and resulted in the development of substitute processes to circumvent these constraints. While continuous improvement is the slow, steady and continuous effort to improve products and/or services, it may not be the best course for some organizations. Ideally, both are needed to maintain a competitive advantage.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Throughout the first half of the 1990s business process re‐engineering (BPR) was one of the most eagerly embraced management techniques, although often with results that were far from satisfactory. This tended to reinforce people’s suspicions of information technology since IT is a key enabling agent, if not the driver, for BPR. The aim of this study was to provide literary evidence and reasons for the current widespread dissatisfaction with BPR. Using the keyword business process re‐engineering/re‐engineering, a total of 2,019 article abstracts were collected that spanned the period from January 1990 to December 1995, inclusive. The literature was analysed for 18 themes, six article types and 32 business areas, in addition to geographical origin, author origin, date, etc. The analysis showed that 97.8 per cent of the BPR literature has been written since the beginning of 1993, since which time there has been an explosive growth in the number of publications. However, a recent sharp downturn in the number of articles may be a sign that BPR is maturing, if not reaching the end of it useful life‐cycle. The almost complete absence of research articles to underpin BPR is a distinctive feature of the literature. Thus, opportunities for researchers, as well as hitherto untapped opportunities for consulting practitioners, are clearly identified. Concludes that, while BPR may not have suffered a sudden fatality, it is the victim of neglect in some critical areas of life support.</jats:p>",

Presents two case studies with examples of software tool analysis results.

The focus is to highlight the differences between the often lofty claims of tool vendors, and both the real needs of BPR analysts and implementors, and the actual capabilities of the BPR tools. The BPA/M tool market has three groups: drawing packages with templates; drawing packages with templates and some spreadsheet‐like capabilities; and the heavyweight BPA/M tools proper, akin to discrete event simulators. The general strengths of such heavyweight tools include: the high price for low software complexity, the large number of confusingly similar tools, the lack of comprehensive standards, and the potential “faddishness” of the tools. Irrespective of evolving management trends, the authors contend that the future use of similar process analysis tools is assured if standards issues are addressed.</jats:p>",

Acquiring a clear definition of the “as‐is” business process and developing an understanding about how the process may be re‐engineered is a crucial stage in any BPR project. This early phase normally has three objectives: to achieve a full understanding of the process to be re‐engineered so as to clarify its objectives and characteristics; to create a shared vision and understanding among the re‐engineering team; to have a basis for starting the redesign. To support this phase, there is a range of tools: manual, computer supported and computer enabled which are traditionally used to help in the activities of process definition and analysis. This paper describes some of the newer approaches. The product introduction process (PIP) is examined in a general sense, and specific examples from the automotive industry are taken as a basis for evaluation of the available tools and applications. A sample from the process analysis tools identified was used to model the PIP, and from the difficulties and successes an understanding of the attributes required in such an analysis tool was derived.</jats:p>",

A number of such conceptualisations of transformation under the banner of “agility” attempt to provide guidance about “managing” physical and social relationships within and between companies in response to growing market complexity. The theoretical argument in this paper is that inter‐firm agility cannot be objectively understood in all cases using simple unidirectional cause and effect as such theories do not take into account more subjective aspects of interaction. Specifically, we argue that to have a vision of agility in action there must be an evaluation of complexity in and between organisational boundaries with a theoretical approach that gives a more robust appreciation of inter‐firm ties. Conceptualising agility in this way captures the essence of tacit knowledge between firms along with the physical dynamics of network functioning.</jats:p>",

Recent developments in the way companies are expected to respond to rapid and unpredictable change in the external environment have resulted in new paradigms for manufacturing which comprise a combination of leanness, agility and virtual enterprises. The primary focus of academic researchers has been in the area of determining how agility is attained in order that organisational structures can best be designed. However, the concept that “what you measure is what you get” is equally valid for virtual organisations as it has always been for stand‐alone manufacturing businesses. This paper therefore discusses the requirements for new approaches to performance measures and raises some of the issues that need to be developed further in support of the concept of agility.</jats:p>",

Although many metadata formats and sets have been developed, it is difficult to choose an appropriate format and conversion is problematical, especially for the Chinese materials. This paper is a progress report from the Metadata Taskforce Group designing Chinese metadata for the digital library and museum project (DLMP) at Academia Sinica in Taiwan. The group’s top priority is to construct goals, principles and procedures while designing the metadata format for Chinese contents. Not only does the Metadata Taskforce Group present the analysis of content attributes of Formosan Plain indigenous people, but also several marked achievements and findings are suggested, such as the metadata record structure and criteria of selecting and evaluating the current metadata formats.</jats:p>",

This paper considers the future of e‐journals in the light of the use and perception of graduate student end‐users, and their expectations of future e‐journals. Some results from a recent user study presenting significant implications for the design of future e‐journals are reported.

Discussion of the processes involved tends to regard them as somehow inappropriate or illegitimate, excessively subjective because not open to scrutiny. The repertory grid is a powerful and precise way of making tacit knowledge explicit; moreover, it rests on a detailed and epistemologically convincing theory of knowledge, personal construct psychology. Both have been used in a great variety of occupations, and this paper will sample some of them, concentrating on the identification of the intuitive factors involved in bank commercial lending, and venture capital investment, decision processes. The willingness of financial institutions to support, and their reluctance to adopt, this particular approach to the identification of tacit knowledge will also be examined.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In the context of possible future directions in the accounting regulatory arena, this paper considers what policy makers can learn from the experiences of Australian managers and investors in relation to capitalization of intangible assets. Focuses on features of the Australian institutional setting, the motivations behind Australian managers’ decisions to capitalize intangible assets, and capital market efficiency implications. Australian GAAP leaves corporate managers wide discretion to capitalize intangible assets irrespective of whether the assets are acquired or generated internally. One central element of this accounting discretion is the historically liberal attitude of Australian accounting regulators to deviations from the historic cost basis of measurement. Concerns about the availability, and abuses, of reliable measures in relation to intangible assets and revalued assets prompted the USA to proscribe these practices generally. Evidence from the Australian setting suggests these concerns could be overstated. Evidence to date suggests Australian equity markets are no less efficient than the USA markets. Existing evidence suggests uncertainty about intangible investment outcomes is a central property of intangible investment which could quasi‐regulate accounting capitalization practice in a discretionary accounting setting. Supports future regulatory deliberations and research focus on the economics of intangible investments, and information search behaviours of investors, as one way to move forward in the regulatory sphere.</jats:p>",

In the presence of a nucleotide acceptor, the phosphohistidine bond is unstable and the phosphate is transferred to the acceptor in less than 1 msec. We describe the synthesis of an analog of the phosphoenzyme intermediate with an inactive mutant of NDP kinase in which the catalytic histidine is replaced by a cysteine. In two sequential disulfide exchange reactions, a thiophosphate group reacts with the thiol function of the cysteine that had previously reacted with dithionitrobenzoate (DTNB). The thiophosphoenzyme presents a 400,000‐fold increased stability in the presence of NDPs compared with the phosphoenzyme. The binding of NDP is studied at the steady state and presteady state. Data were analyzed according to a bimolecular association model. For the first time, the true equilibrium dissociation constants of NDP for the analog of the phosphoenzyme are determined in the absence of phosphotransfer, allowing a better understanding of the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Recently, we found that ferricytochrome c (ferricyt c) undergoes significant structural changes in mixed aqueous–nonaqueous media, resulting in the formation of a mixture of alkaline‐like species. The equilibrium composition of this mixture of species is dependent on the dielectric constant of the mixed solvent medium. One‐dimensional (1D) and two‐dimensional (2D) <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods have now been used to study these alkaline‐like forms in 30% acetonitrile–water solution. A native‐like (M80‐ligated) III* form, two lysine‐ligated forms (IVa* and IVb*), and a hydroxide‐ligated form (V*) were observed. Heme proton resonance assignments for these forms were accomplished using 1D <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H NMR and 2D nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy methods at 20°C and 35°C. The chemical exchange between the alkaline forms in 30% acetonitrile solution facilitated heme proton resonance assignments. Based on examination of the heme proton chemical shifts and several highly conserved amino acid residues, the electronic structure, secondary structure, and hydrogen bond network in the vicinity of the heme in the III* form were found to be intact. Similarly, the heme electronic structure of the IVa* form was found to be comparable to that of the IVa form. Differences in the order of the heme methyl resonances in the IVb* form, however, suggest that the heme active site in this form is somewhat different from that observed in aqueous alkaline solution. In addition, resonance assignments for the 8‐ and 3‐methyl heme protons were made for the hydroxide‐ligated V* form for the first time. The observation of chemical exchange peaks between all species except IVb* and IVa* or V* was used to propose an exchange pathway between the different forms of ferricyt c in 30% acetonitrile solution. This pathway may be biologically significant because ferricyt c, which resides in the intermembrane space of mitochondria, is exposed to medium of relatively low dielectric constant when it interacts with the mitochondrial membrane.</jats:p>",

This phenomenon, which is expected to play an important role during the early stages of protein folding, has been investigated using 76 proteins for which two high‐resolution X‐ray conformations are available. Peptide‐plane flips are identified by looking for those cases where changes in |ψ<jats:sub>i</jats:sub>| + |ϕ<jats:sub>i</jats:sub> <jats:sub>+ 1</jats:sub>| are large (&gt;200°), but changes in |ψ<jats:sub>i</jats:sub> + ϕ<jats:sub>i</jats:sub> <jats:sub>+ 1</jats:sub>| are comparatively small (&lt;50°). Of a total of 23 cases, the most common peptide‐plane flip was identified to be the type I to type II β‐turn interconversion. Although individually rarer, there are many other types of flips that are collectively more common. Given the four main accessible regions α<jats:sub>R</jats:sub>, α<jats:sub>L</jats:sub>, β and ε, identified from the ϕ,ψ distribution corresponding to non‐hydrogen‐bonded peptide planes, 32 main types of peptide‐plane flip are identified. Only 8 of these are “passive,” in that they require only relatively minor adjustments in the orientation of adjacent peptide planes. Of these, only the type I to type II β‐turn interconversion, denoted, β(<jats:italic>i</jats:italic>) + α<jats:sub>L</jats:sub>(<jats:italic>i</jats:italic> + 1) ― α<jats:sub>R</jats:sub>(<jats:italic>i</jats:italic>) + α<jats:sub>R</jats:sub>(<jats:italic>i</jats:italic> + 1), and the rarer α<jats:sub>R</jats:sub>(<jats:italic>i</jats:italic>) + α<jats:sub>L</jats:sub>(<jats:italic>i</jats:italic> + 1) ― β(<jats:italic>i</jats:italic>) + α<jats:sub>R</jats:sub>(<jats:italic>i</jats:italic> + 1), do not involve the ε region. “Active” peptide‐plane flips affect the orientation of adjacent peptide planes.

The chaperone activity of PPIase was studied using inactive, active, and alkylated PPIase during rabbit muscle creatine kinase (CK) refolding. The results showed that low concentration inactive or active PPIase was able to improve the refolding yields, while high concentration PPIase decreased the CK reactivation yields. Aggregation was inhibited by inactive or active PPIase, and completely suppressed at 32 or 80 times the CK concentration (2.7 μM). However, alkylated PPIase was not able to prevent CK aggregation. In addition, the ability of inactive PPIase to affect CK reactivation and prevent CK aggregation was weaker than that of active PPIase. These results indicate that PPIase interacted with the early folding intermediates of CK, thus preventing their aggregation in a concentration‐dependent manner. PPIase exhibited chaperone‐like activity during CK refolding. The results also suggest that the isomerase activity of PPIase was independent of the chaperone activity, and that the proper molar ratio was important for the chaperone activity of PPIase. The cysteine residues of PPIase may be a peptide binding site, and may be an essential group for the chaperone function.</jats:p>",

In this article, a more general framework for the modeling of the denatured state is proposed. It is based on the assumption that the titratable groups of an unfolded protein can adopt a quasi‐random distribution restricted by the protein sequence. The model was applied for the calculations of electrostatic interactions in two proteins, barnase and N‐terminal domain of the ribosomal protein L9. The calculated free energy of denaturation, Δ<jats:italic>G</jats:italic>(pH), reproduces the experimental data better than the commonly used null approximation (NA). It was shown that the seemingly good agreement with experimental data obtained by NA originates from the compensatory effect between the pairwise electrostatic interactions and the desolvation energy of the individual sites.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Slowly varying Hamiltonian systems, for which action is a well‐known adiabatic invariant, are considered in the case where the system undergoes a saddle center bifurcation. We analyze the situation in which the solution slowly passes through the nonhyperbolic homoclinic orbit created at the saddle‐center bifurcation. The solution near this homoclinic orbit consists of a large sequence of homoclinic orbits surrounded by near approaches to the autonomous nonlinear nonhyperbolic saddle point. By matching this solution to the strongly nonlinear oscillations obtained by averaging before and after crossing the homoclinic orbit, we determine the change in the action. If one orbit comes sufficiently close to the nonlinear saddle point, then that one saddle approach instead satisfies the nonautonomous first Painlevé equation, whose stable manifold of the unstable saddle (created in the saddle‐center bifurcation) separates solutions approaching the stable center from those involving sequences of nearly homoclinic orbits.</jats:p>",

Consequently, eigenfunctions of the linearization operators are precisely squared eigenfunctions of the associated eigenvalue problem.

The Kv channel complexes targeted by Kvβ2 and/or Kv1α subunit elimination contributed to action potential repolarization because elimination of either or both subunits led to increases in the duration of the action potential.

The overall goal of this study was to define how SK and BK channels respond to Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> signals from voltage‐dependent Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> channels (VDCCs) in the surface membrane and from ryanodine‐sensitive Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> release channels or ryanodine receptors (RyRs) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane. To characterize the role of SK channels in UBSM, the effects of the SK channel blocker apamin on phasic contractions were examined. Apamin caused a dose‐dependent increase in the amplitude of phasic contractions over a broad concentration range (10<jats:sup>−10</jats:sup> to 10<jats:sup>−6</jats:sup><jats:sc>m</jats:sc>). To determine the effects of Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> signals from VDCCs and RyRs to SK and BK channels, whole cell membrane current was measured in isolated myocytes bathed in physiological solutions. Depolarization (‐70 to +10 mV for 100 ms) of isolated myocytes caused an inward Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> current (<jats:italic>I</jats:italic><jats:sub>Ca</jats:sub>), followed by an outward current. The outward current was reduced in a dose‐dependent manner by apamin (10<jats:sup>−10</jats:sup> to 10<jats:sup>−6</jats:sup><jats:sc>m</jats:sc>), and designated <jats:italic>I</jats:italic><jats:sub>SK</jats:sub>. <jats:italic>I</jats:italic><jats:sub>SK</jats:sub> had a mean amplitude of 53.8 ± 6.1 pA or ∼1.4 pA pF<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> at +10 mV. The amplitude of <jats:italic>I</jats:italic><jats:sub>SK</jats:sub> correlated with the peak <jats:italic>I</jats:italic><jats:sub>Ca</jats:sub>. Blocking <jats:italic>I</jats:italic><jats:sub>Ca</jats:sub> abolished <jats:italic>I</jats:italic><jats:sub>SK</jats:sub>. In contrast, <jats:italic>I</jats:italic><jats:sub>SK</jats:sub> was insensitive to the RyR blocker ryanodine (10 μM). These data indicate that Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> signals from VDCCs, but not from RyRs, activate SK channels. BK channel currents (<jats:italic>I</jats:italic><jats:sub>BK</jats:sub>) were isolated from other currents by using the BK channel blockers tetraethylammonium ions (TEA<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>; 1 m<jats:sc>m</jats:sc>) or iberiotoxin (200 n<jats:sc>m</jats:sc>). Voltage steps evoked transient and steady‐state <jats:italic>I</jats:italic><jats:sub>BK</jats:sub> components. Transient BK currents have previously been shown to result from BK channel activation by local Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> release through RyRs (‘Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> sparks’). Transient BK currents were inhibited by ryanodine (10 μM), as expected, and had a mean amplitude of 152.6 pA at +10 mV. The mean number of transient BK currents during a voltage step (range 0 to 3) correlated with <jats:italic>I</jats:italic><jats:sub>Ca</jats:sub>. There was a long delay (52.4 ± 2.7 ms) between activation of <jats:italic>I</jats:italic><jats:sub>Ca</jats:sub> and the first transient BK current. In contrast, ryanodine did not affect the steady‐state BK current (mean amplitude 135.4 pA) during the voltage step. The steady‐state BK current was reduced 95 % by inhibition of VDCCs, suggesting that this process depends largely on Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> entry through VDCCs and not Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> release through RyRs. These results indicate that Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> entry through VDCCs activates both BK and SK channels, but Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> release (Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> sparks) through RyRs activates only BK channels.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Responses of human sensory and motor axons to the release of ischaemia and to hyperpolarizing currents",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>This study compared directly the post‐ischaemic behaviour of sensory and motor axons in the human median nerve, focusing on the excitability changes produced by ischaemia and its release and by continuous polarizing DC. The decrease in threshold during ischaemia for 13 min was greater, the post‐ischaemic increase in threshold was more rapid, and the return to the pre‐ischaemic excitability took longer in sensory axons. However, a transient depolarizing threshold shift developed in sensory axons a few minutes after release of ischaemia. This pattern could not be reproduced by polarizing currents designed to mimic the probable pump‐induced changes in membrane potential, even though the applied currents produced greater changes in threshold. Hyperpolarizing currents of equivalent intensity produced a greater increase in threshold for motor axons than sensory axons and, in studies of threshold electrotonus using graded hyperpolarizing DC, accommodation was greater in sensory than motor axons. The post‐ischaemic changes in threshold were not uniform for axons of different threshold, whether sensory or motor, the threshold increase was usually less prominent for low‐threshold axons. A transient post‐ischaemic depolarization could be produced in motor axons with ischaemia of 20 min duration. Greater ischaemic and post‐ischaemic changes in threshold for sensory axons could reflect greater dependence on the electrogenic Na<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>‐K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> pump to maintain resting membrane potential and/or greater extracellular K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> accumulation in ischaemic sensory axons. Inward K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> currents due to extracellular K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> accumulation would then be more likely to trigger a depolarizing shift in membrane potential, the degree of K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> accumulation and pump activity being dependent on the duration of ischaemia. In sensory axons the greater tendency to accommodate to hyperpolarizing stimuli presumably contributes to shaping their post‐ischaemic behaviour but is probably insufficient to explain why their behaviour differs from that of motor axons.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The field of quantitative evolutionary design uses evolutionary reasoning (in terms of natural selection and ultimate causation) to understand the magnitudes of biological reserve capacities, i.e. excesses of capacities over natural loads. Ratios of capacities to loads, defined as safety factors, fall in the range 1.2‐10 for most engineered and biological components, even though engineered safety factors are specified intentionally by humans while biological safety factors arise through natural selection. Familiar examples of engineered safety factors include those of buildings, bridges and elevators (lifts), while biological examples include factors of bones and other structural elements, of enzymes and transporters, and of organ metabolic performances. Safety factors serve to minimize the overlap zone (resulting in performance failure) between the low tail of capacity distributions and the high tail of load distributions. Safety factors increase with coefficients of variation of load and capacity, with capacity deterioration with time, and with cost of failure, and decrease with costs of initial construction, maintenance, operation, and opportunity. Adaptive regulation of many biological systems involves capacity increases with increasing load; several quantitative examples suggest sublinear increases, such that safety factors decrease towards 1.0. Unsolved questions include safety factors of series systems, parallel or branched pathways, elements with multiple functions, enzyme reaction chains, and equilibrium enzymes. The modest sizes of safety factors imply the existence of costs that penalize excess capacities. Those costs are likely to involve wasted energy or space for large or expensive components, but opportunity costs of wasted space at the molecular level for minor components.</jats:p>",

We measured the safety factor of the mouse intestinal brush‐border hydrolase maltase in series with the glucose transporter SGLT1, for comparison with previous studies of sucrase and lactase. Dietary maltose loads increased 4‐fold from virgin to lactating mice. As in previous studies of intestinal adaptive regulation, that increase in load without change in dietary composition resulted in an increase in maltase and SGLT1 capacities mediated non‐specifically by an increase in intestinal mass, without change in maltase or SGLT1 activities per milligram of tissue. Maltase and SGLT1 capacities increased only sublinearly with load during lactation, such that safety factors decreased with load: from 6.5 to 2.4 for maltase, and from 1.1 to 0.5 for SGLT1. The apparently high safety factor for maltase may be related to the multiple natural substrates hydrolysed by the multiple sites of maltase activity. The apparently low safety factor for SGLT1 is made possible by the contribution of hindgut fermentation to carbohydrate digestion. SGLT1 activity is paradoxically higher for mice consuming sucrose than for mice consuming maltose, despite maltose hydrolysis yielding double the glucose load yielded by sucrose hydrolysis, and despite glucose constituting the load upon SGLT1.</jats:p>",

It is becoming increasingly difficult to suppress chatter during cutting at high speeds. Many investigators have regarded chatter vibrations as a “natural” phenomenon during the cutting process and a part of the process itself. In classical machining operations with thick-walled workpieces chatter vibrations occur when the cutting depth exceeds stability limits dependent on the machine tool. On the other hand, in the case of thin-walled cylindrical workpieces, chatter vibration problems are not so simple to formulate. The main purpose of this study is to qualify the dynamic behavior of a thin-walled workpiece during the turning process. It contains two parts: the cutting process simulation and the definition of experimental stability criteria. In the first part, a numerical model, which simulates the turning process of thin-walled cylindrical workpieces, is proposed. This model also permits obtaining workpiece responses to excitation generated by cutting forces. Finally, the stability of the process is discussed.</jats:p>",

The work is part of the predesign study of a high-pressure subsonic turbine for a rocket engine turbopump. The pressure level in such turbines can be remarkably high (in this case 54 MPa inlet total pressure). Hence, large unsteady rotor blade loads can be expected, which impose difficult design requirements. The parameter studies are performed at midspan with the numerical flow solver UNSFLO, a 2-D/Q3-D unsteady hybrid Euler/Navier-Stokes solver. Comparisons to 2-D and steady 3-D results obtained with a fully viscous solver, VOLSOL, are made. The investigated design parameters are the axial gap (∼8–29 percent of rotor axial chord length) and the stator vane size and count (stator-rotor pitch ratio ∼1–2.75). For the nominal case the numerical solution is analyzed regarding the contributions of potential and vortical flow disturbances at the rotor inlet using rotor gust computations. It was found that gust calculations were not capable to capture the complexity of the detected excitation mechanisms, but the possibility to reduce excitations by enforcing cancellation of the vortical and potential effects has been elaborated. The potential excitation mechanism in the present turbine stage is found dominant compared to relatively small and local wake excitation effects. The parameter studies indicate design recommendations for the axial gap and the stator size regarding the unsteady rotor load.</jats:p>",

To explore the geometry effects of short obstacles, the height less than one hydraulic diameter (d), three cross-sectional shapes of obstacles, i.e., circular, square and diamond, with variations in number of obstacles, obstacle spacing, and free-stream Reynolds number are considered. The maximum number of the obstacles in tandem array is 3 and the spacing between obstacles is 1d, 2d, or 4d. The free-stream Reynolds number ranges from 2100 to 4200. The experimental results reveal that the local heat transfer enhancement in front of leading circular and square obstacles are better than the diamond one, while the influenced area by the obstacle of the diamond shape is most remarkable. The present results disclose that an intermediate height (0.5d) of the protruding elements is more beneficial to the heat transfer enhancement in wake of the obstacle. With the sweepback leading edge of the top surface, the diamond and circular obstacles produce vortical flow across the obstacles and thus enhance heat transfer downstream in wake. Increasing Reynolds number leads to an enhancement in heat transfer performance. The number of and the spacing between the obstacles in tandem array are also influential factors to the flow structure and heat transfer enhancement on the basic plate.</jats:p>",

A two-dimensional axisymmetric case is considered and governing equations of heat transfer and flow are solved numerically using a control volume approach while stress equations are solved using the finite element method (FEM). In this analysis, a gas jet impinging onto the workpiece surface coaxially with the laser beam is considered. A low-Reynolds number k−ε model is introduced to account for the turbulence. When computing the temperature and stress fields two repetitive pulse types and variable properties of workpiece, and gas jet are taken into account. Temperature predictions were discussed in a previous study. A stress field is examined at present. It is found that the radial stress component is compressive while its axial counterpart is tensile. The temporal behavior of the equivalent stress almost follows the temperature field in the workpiece. The pulse type 1 results in higher equivalent stress in the workpiece as compared to that corresponding to pulse type 2.</jats:p>",

The shell theory of Sanders, including the effect of pressure, is used in formulating the governing equations. These partial differential equations are reduced to ordinary differential equations with variable coefficients using complete waves in the form of trigonometric functions in the longitudinal direction. The assumed mode shapes are divided into symmetric and antisymmetric groups, each given by a Fourier series in the meridional coordinate. The solutions (natural frequencies and mode shapes) are obtained using Galerkin’s method and verified with published results. The natural frequencies are also obtained for a circular cylinder with shear diaphragm boundary condition as a special case of the toroidal shell.

In this approach, an eigenvector expansion method is used to obtain the response of the system. The properties of Laplace transforms of convolution integrals are used to write a set of general Duhamel integral type expressions for the response of the system. The general response contains two parts, namely zero state and zero input. For a stochastic analysis, the input force is treated as a random process with specified mean and correlation functions. An expectation operator is applied on a set of expressions to obtain the stochastic characteristics, namely the variance and covariance responses of the system. Closed form stochastic response expressions are obtained for white noise. Numerical results are presented to show the stochastic response of a fractionally damped system subjected to white noise. Results show that stochastic response of the fractionally damped system oscillates even when the damping ratio is greater than its critical value.</jats:p>",

The simulations show that in a wide rotating speed range there are several extra resonance frequencies, which are different from those appearing in well-known linear models. When a power failure occurs to AMB machinery, the AMB rotor should pass through all these resonance frequencies. Under some conditions, the full clearance whirl motion of the rotor in backup bearings will happen, which may lead to damage. In this paper several measures that could reduce the nonlinear response and hence avoid the full clearance motion are discussed.</jats:p>",

Quadrupole mass analyzer and appearance mass spectrometry have been used for the measurement of fluorocarbon ions, radicals. Densities of all radicals increased with the increase of stage temperature and the decrease of the gap distance between stage and detection point. On the other side, the concentrations of fluorocarbon ions decreased slightly when the stage temperature went down. It has been investigated that the density variation of the radicals dependent on the stage temperature could be controlled with gas residence time. It is considered that the balance between pumping loss rate and surface loss rate has a responsibility for the residence time effects on radical density variations. Finally, constant amounts of radicals were desorbed from the stage along with discharge time when we applied rf bias to the stage.

Radiochromic film measurements were performed in an in‐house manufactured polystyrene phantom with the films oriented either along or perpendicular to the beam axis. Monte Carlo simulations were performed with BEAM and EGSnrc. Calculations were also performed using the pencil beam (PB) algorithm and the collapsed cone convolution (CCC) algorithm of Helax–TMS (MDS Nordion, Kanata, Canada) version 6.0.2 and using the CCC algorithm of Pinnacle (ADAC Laboratories, Milpitas, CA, USA) version 4.2. A very good agreement between the film measurements and the Monte Carlo simulations was found. The CCC algorithms were not able to predict the interface dose accurately when lateral electronic disequilibrium occurs, but were shown to be a considerable improvement compared to the PB algorithm. The CCC algorithms overestimate the dose in the rebuild‐up region. The interface dose was overestimated by a maximum of 31% or 54%, depending on the implementation of the CCC algorithm. At a depth of 1 mm, the maximum dose overestimation was 14% or 24%.</jats:p>",

The present paper provides a brief review of clinical considerations in radiation oncology, statistics for the most prevalent cancers, and how those cancers that account for over 90% of mortality are currently treated. With these data as background, it then considers the extent to which one of the more widely promoted new technologies is likely to impact upon survival.

Together with the newly developed phase‐correlated cardiac reconstruction algorithms 180°MCD and 180°MCI [Med. Phys. <jats:bold>27</jats:bold>, 1881–1902 (2000)] or related algorithms provided by the CT manufacturers, high image quality can be achieved. These algorithms require information about the cardiac motion, i.e., typically the simultaneously recorded electrocardiogram (ECG), to synchronize the reconstruction with the cardiac motion. Neither data acquired without ECG information (standard patients) nor acquisitions with corrupted ECG information can be handled adequately. We developed a method to extract the appropriate information about cardiac motion directly from the measured raw data (projection data). The so‐called kymogram function is a measure of the cardiac motion as a function of time <jats:italic>t</jats:italic> or as a function of the projection angle α. In contrast to the ECG which is a global measure of the heart's electric excitation, the kymogram is a local measure of the heart motion at the <jats:italic>z</jats:italic>‐position <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp7861-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp7861:mp7861-math-0001\" /> at projection angle α. The patient's local heart rate as well as the necessary synchronization information to be used with phase‐correlated algorithms can be extracted from the kymogram by using a series of signal processing steps. The kymogram information is shown to be adequate to substitute the ECG information. Computer simulations with simulated ECG and patient measurements with simultaneously acquired ECG were carried out for a multislice scanner providing <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp7861-math-0002.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp7861:mp7861-math-0002\" /> slices to evaluate these new approaches. Both the ECG function and the kymogram function were used for reconstruction. Both were highly correlated regarding the periodicity information used for reconstruction. In 21 out of 25 consecutive cases the kymogram approach was equivalent to the ECG‐correlated reconstruction; only minor differences in image quality between both methods were observed. For one patient the synchronization information detected by the ECG monitor turned out to be wrong; here, the kymogram constituted the only approach that provided useful reconstructions. Patient studies with 12 and 16 slices indicate the usefulness of our approach for cone‐beam CT scans. Kymogram‐correlated reconstructions also appear to have the potential to improve imaging of pericardial lung areas in general.</jats:p>",

Because metric lengths are the physically measured lengths, their use makes it possible to understand general relativity directly in terms of physical quantities such as energy and momentum within a curved space–time. The metric form of the second law contains gravitational effects in exactly the same manner as occurs in relativity. Its mathematical derivation uses vectors rather than tensors, and nongravitational forces can occur in this modified second law without a tensor form. Because quantum mechanics is based on Newtonian concepts of energy and momentum, it is shown that when metric lengths replace coordinate lengths in Dirac’s wave equation, it has a covariant form under a metric transformation of the physically measured distances themselves, rather than a coordinate transformation.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Extensions of a time-domain diffraction tomography method, which reconstructs spatially dependent sound speed variations from far-field time-domain acoustic scattering measurements, are presented and analyzed. The resulting reconstructions are quantitative images with applications including ultrasonic mammography, and can also be considered candidate solutions to the time-domain inverse scattering problem. Here, the linearized time-domain inverse scattering problem is shown to have no general solution for finite signal bandwidth. However, an approximate solution to the linearized problem is constructed using a simple delay-and-sum method analogous to “gold standard” ultrasonic beamforming. The form of this solution suggests that the full nonlinear inverse scattering problem can be approximated by applying appropriate angle- and space-dependent time shifts to the time-domain scattering data; this analogy leads to a general approach to aberration correction. Two related methods for aberration correction are presented: one in which delays are computed from estimates of the medium using an efficient straight-ray approximation, and one in which delays are applied directly to a time-dependent linearized reconstruction. Numerical results indicate that these correction methods achieve substantial quality improvements for imaging of large scatterers. The parametric range of applicability for the time-domain diffraction tomography method is increased by about a factor of 2 by aberration correction.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Spectral integration in bands of modulated or unmodulated noise",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Spectral integration was measured for pure-tone signals masked by unmodulated or modulated noise bands centered at the signal frequencies. The bands were typically 100 Hz wide, and when modulated, they were sinusoidally amplitude modulated at a rate of 8 Hz and a depth of 100%. In experiment 1, thresholds were first measured for each individual pure tone of a triplet in the presence of its respective masker band, and then for those three tones added together at their respective threshold levels, masked by their respective masker bands. Four sets of triplets were used: 250, 1000, 4000 Hz; 354, 1000, 2828 Hz; 500, 1000, 2000 Hz; and 800, 1000, 1200 Hz. When the masker bands were unmodulated, the amount of spectral integration was about 2.4 dB for all triplets, consistent with the integration expected based on the multiband energy detector model. When the bands were modulated, the amount of integration depended upon the spacing between masker bands; for the two widest spacings, the integration was between about 0 and 3 dB, whereas for the two closest spacings, the integration was approximately 5 dB. Experiments 2 and 3 addressed the cause of this greater spectral integration in the presence of the modulated masker bands with closer spacing. The second experiment demonstrated that sensitivity (d′) was proportional to signal power regardless of whether the background noise was modulated or not, and thus the greater integration in dB in the presence of the modulated noise bands could not be accounted for by shallower psychometric functions in those conditions. Instead, the third experiment showed that the greater integration was likely due to the fact that the masker bands were comodulated. In other words, it was probably due to cues related to comodulation masking release when all three bands (and signals) were present.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Effects of signal delay on auditory filter shapes derived from psychophysical tuning curves and notched-noise data obtained in simultaneous masking",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Psychophysical tuning curves (PTCs) measured in simultaneous masking usually sharpen as a short duration signal is moved from the onset to the temporal center of a longer duration masker. Filter shapes derived from notched-noise maskers have not consistently shown this effect. One possible explanation for this difference is that the signal level is fixed in the PTC paradigm, whereas the masker level is usually fixed in the notched-noise paradigm. In the present study, the signal level was fixed at 10 dB SL in both paradigms. The signal was 20 ms in duration, and presented at the onset or temporal center of the 400-ms masker. The masker was a pure tone presented in quiet (PTC) or in the presence of a pure-tone “restrictor” intended to limit off-frequency listening (PTCr), or it was a noise with a spectral notch placed symmetrically or asymmetrically about the 2-kHz signal frequency. Filter shapes were derived from the PTC, PTCr, and notched-noise data using the roex (p, w, t) model. The effects of signal delay and masking paradigm on filter bandwidth were analyzed with a two-factor repeated-measures ANOVA. There was a significant effect of signal delay (the filters sharpened with time) and masking paradigm (the filters derived from the notched-noise data were significantly wider than those derived from either of the PTC measurements, which did not differ from one another). Although the interaction between delay and paradigm was not significant, the filter derived from the notched-noise data sharpened more with time than did the other filters, and thus the bandwidth of the filters from the three paradigms were more similar at the longer delay than at the shorter delay. It is likely that the tuning-curve and notched-noise paradigms measure the same underlying filtering, but that various other factors contribute differentially to the derived filter shapes.</jats:p>",

Underwater auditory thresholds were determined for a California sea lion at depths ranging from 10 to 100 meters. The following results were obtained: (1) False alarm probabilities (responding in the absence of a signal) decreased significantly with depth, indicating that the sea lion adopted a more conservative response criterion in deeper water. (2) Hearing sensitivity generally worsened with depth. (3) There was a significant interaction between depth and frequency, the depth effect being most pronounced at 10 kHz and reversing at 35 kHz. Increasing pressure related to diving probably alters the impedance characteristics of the pinniped ear, in particular affecting the size of the middle-ear air space via expansion of cavernous tissue in the middle-ear cavity. These results show that the middle ear plays a functional role in underwater sound detection in sea lions. However, contrary to previous speculation, the presence of cavernous tissue in the sea lion middle ear does not appear to enhance sensitivity at depth.</jats:p>",

However, the speech used for training is often compressed in order to decrease the number of packets transmitted, without an evaluation of whether the compression causes a decrease in intelligibility. The current study assessed the intelligibility of compressed speech in order to determine whether it is appropriate for use in Internet-based training. English words minimally contrasting in /r/ and /l/, /b/ and /v/, or /s/ and /th/ were recorded from native speakers of English and compressed using several different methods (MP3, WMA, QCELP, ADPCM, etc.). The intelligibility of these speech files was then evaluated by a group of native English speakers and a group of native Japanese speakers, using a minimal-pair identification task. Results showed that: (1) intelligibility scores for Japanese speakers were lower than those for the English speakers, as was expected; and (2) intelligibility of /r/–/l/ stimuli was unaltered by the compression, whereas intelligibility of /s/–/th/ stimuli dropped remarkably in several formats, and that of /b/–/v/ stimuli dropped only in QCELP-compressed words. These findings suggest that some compression formats are not appropriate in speech perception training. Implications for Internet educational materials will be discussed.</jats:p>",

Electrostrictive and alignment forces as well as chain cooperativity are responsible for the osmotic compression of the polymer solute.

The current technology, chemically amplified photoresists, uses a complex reaction-diffusion process to delineate patterned areas with high spatial resolution. However, nanometer-level control of this critical process is limited by the lack of direct measurements of the reaction front. We demonstrate the use of x-ray and neutron reflectometry as a general method to measure the spatial evolution of the reaction-diffusion process with nanometer resolution. Measuring compositional profiles, provided by deuterium-labeled reactant groups for neutron scattering contrast, we show that the reaction front within the material is broad rather than sharply defined and the compositional profile is altered during development. Measuring the density profile, we directly correlate the developed film structure with that of the reaction front.</jats:p>",

Because NB form surface calcifications at physiologic levels of calcium and phosphate, they have been hypothesized to mediate the formation of tissue calcifications. We describe a modified microdilution inhibitory test that accommodates the unique growth conditions and long multiplication times of NB. This modified microdilution method included inoculation of 96-well plates and determination of inhibition by periodic measurement of the absorbance for 14 days in cell culture medium under cell culture conditions. Bactericidal or bacteriostatic drug effects were distinguished by subsequent subculture in drug-free media and monitoring for increasing absorbance. NB isolated from fetal bovine serum (FBS) were inhibited by tetracycline HCl, nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and ampicillin at levels achievable in serum and urine; all drugs except ampicillin were cidal. Tetracycline also inhibited multiplication of isolates of NB from human kidney stones and kidney cyst fluids from patients with PKD. The other antibiotics tested against FBS-derived NB either had no effect or exhibited an inhibitory concentration above clinically achievable levels; the aminoglycosides and vancomycin were bacteriostatic. Antibiotic-induced morphological changes to NB were observed by electron microscopy. Bisphosphonates, aminocaproic acid, potassium citrate-citric acid solutions, and 5-fluorouracil also inhibited the multiplication of NB in a cidal manner. Insights into the nature of NB, the action(s) of these drugs, and the role of NB in calcifying diseases may be gained by exploiting this in vitro inhibition test system.</jats:p>",

We sought to determine the effect of azithromycin at different doses on the density of middle ear infection due to NTHI to provide additional understanding of this dichotomy between clinical and microbiologic outcome measures in AOM. In a chinchilla model of experimental otitis media (EOM), animals treated with placebo were compared to animals receiving a single daily dose 30 or 120 mg of azithromycin per kg of body weight per day for 5 days. Microbiologic outcome was assessed by obtaining quantitative cultures from the middle ear during a 5-day course and for 1 week following therapy. Azithromycin concentrations were measured to ascertain whether a concentration-dependent effect was present. Azithromycin at 30 and 120 mg/kg/day demonstrated a dose-dependent effect on the quantitative assessment of middle ear infection due to NTHI. A 30-mg/kg dose of azithromycin daily resulted in levels in serum and areas under the serum concentration-time curve at 24 h comparable to published data obtained with children given azithromycin at 5 to 10 mg/kg in multiday regimens. Increased doses of azithromycin (120 mg/kg) achieved 2.5- to 4-fold-higher levels in serum and 3- to 6-fold-higher total levels and levels in extracellular middle ear fluid as well as more rapid reduction in bacterial density and a greater proportion of middle ears with complete sterilization than either placebo or the 30-mg/kg/day regimen.</jats:p>",

The control of temperature therefore appears to be critical for all three cephalosporins that cannot be recommended for use in portable pumps carried under clothes for prolonged periods for reasons of stability. Cefpirome and cefepime solutions developed an important color change (from light yellow to dark red) upon exposure when stored at 30°C or higher. Degradation of ceftazidime was accompanied by the liberation of pyridine which, at 37°C, was in excess of what is allowed by the U.S. Pharmacopeia, i.e., 1.1 mg/liter, after 8 and 12 h for drug concentrations of 12 and 8.3%, respectively. Imipenem and meropenem are too unstable (10% degradation at 25°C after 3.5 and 5.15 h, respectively) to be recommended for use by continuous infusion.

The method relies on the use of an ordered genomic library composed of PCR amplicons that were generated under error-prone conditions so as to introduce random mutations into the DNA. Since some of the mutations occur in drug target-encoding genes and subsequently affect the binding of the drug to its respective cellular target, amplicons containing drug targets can be identified as those producing drug-resistant colonies when transformed into\n            <jats:italic>S. pneumoniae</jats:italic>\n            . Examination of the genetic content of the amplicon giving resistance coupled with bioinformatics and additional genetic approaches could be used to rapidly identify candidate drug target genes. The utility of this approach was verified by using a number of known antibiotics. For drugs with single protein targets, amplicons were identified that rendered\n            <jats:italic>S. pneumoniae</jats:italic>\n            drug resistant. Assessment of amplicon composition revealed that each of the relevant amplicons contained the gene encoding the known target for the particular drug tested. Fusidic acid-resistant mutants that resulted from the transformation of\n            <jats:italic>S. pneumoniae</jats:italic>\n            with amplicons containing\n            <jats:italic>fusA</jats:italic>\n            were further characterized by sequence analysis.

The gain of fitness occurred during a bloom of all cultivable agrobacteria observed only in conducive soils. An evolution of the pathogenic population was recorded during a 4-year period in one particularly conducive soil. In 1990, the pathogenic population in this soil consisted of only biovar 1 strains harboring both octopine- and nopaline-type Ti plasmids. In 1994, it consisted of only nopaline-type Ti plasmids equally distributed among biovar 1 and 2 strains.

Growth of\n            <jats:italic>L. curvatus</jats:italic>\n            in solid medium is dependent on the number of cells in a colony.

Comparison of partial 5S rRNA sequences enabled detection of changes in single taxa over space and during seasons. Overall, the bacterioplankton community was dominated by 3 to 14 abundant (&gt;4% of the total 5S rRNA) taxa.

Species of this protozoan blood parasite that have routinely been isolated from mice (<jats:italic>B. microti</jats:italic>) or cattle (<jats:italic>B. divergens</jats:italic>) have also been isolated from humans. In addition to these familiar species, new isolates that resist being placed in existing taxonomic categories are the basis for rethinking their phylogenetic relationships based on sequencing data. The parasite represents a threat to the safety of the blood supply in that blood from asymptomatic humans can transmit<jats:italic>Babesia</jats:italic>to blood recipients. Such transmissions have occurred. The development of methods for cultivation of these organisms represents a significant opportunity to study their biology and disease potential. In addition, in vitro cultivation has provided a basis for studying immune responses of mammals to these infectious agents, with the hope of ultimately producing attenuated strains that could be used for immunizing of cattle and, perhaps, humans who live in areas of endemicity. The microaerophilous stationary phase culture technique, which uses a tissue culture medium base supplemented with appropriate serum and erythrocytes, has made it possible to obtain large numbers of parasitized erythrocytes for studying the biology of this parasite.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Profiles of cell-bound proteins were compared among RDP types. Proteins that showed a remarkable difference in the degree of expression were found among strains of RDP Ia-3, which has been considered potentially virulent, as well as of RDP Ib-1. For RDP Ia-3 strains, the protein was predominant in strains from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) but was mostly a minor component in other strains. For RDP Ib-1 strains, the protein was predominant in strains from CSF, showed diversity in strains from blood, and was mostly a minor component in other strains. By N-terminal sequencing analysis, the protein was identified as a C protein β antigen. The level of bound immunoglobulin A (IgA) or anti-β antigen monoclonal antibody correlated with the level of expressed β antigen, and invasive strains showed remarkably high levels of binding; the exception was a CSF-derived strain of RDP Ib-1 which produced a large amount of β antigen and showed a high level of binding of anti-β antigen monoclonal antibody but no IgA binding. PCR-based amplification revealed that the β antigen gene was detected in all RDP Ia-3 and Ib-1 strains but was not found in any strains of other RDP types. Competitive reverse transcriptase PCR demonstrated that the difference in the amount of protein produced was due to the difference in the level of expression of the β antigen mRNA. Our findings imply that differences in gene expression for a protein may contribute to the invasiveness of RDP Ia-3 and Ib-1 strains for the host.</jats:p>",

The high-throughput, semiautomated assays described here were developed to provide a method suitable for screening plasma specimens for the presence of HIV-1 and HCV RNAs. Three assays were developed: a multiplex HIV-1/HCV assay for simultaneous detection of HIV-1 and HCV, and discriminatory assays for specific detection of HIV-1 and HCV. The assay systems utilize three proprietary technologies: (i) target capture-based sample preparation, (ii) transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), and (iii) hybridization protection assay (HPA). An internal control is incorporated into each reaction to control for every step of the assay and identify random false-negative reactions. The assays demonstrated a sensitivity of at least 100 copies/ml for each target, and they detected with similar sensitivity all major variants of HCV and HIV-1, including HIV-1 group O strains. Assay sensitivity for one virus was not affected by the presence of the other. The specificity of these TMA-driven assays was ≥99.5% in both normal donor specimens and plasma containing potentially interfering substances or other blood-borne pathogens. Statistical receiver operating characteristic plots of 1 − specificity versus sensitivity data determined very wide analyte cutoff values for each assay at the point at which the assay specificity and sensitivity were both ≥99.5%.

For identification of\n            <jats:italic>S. aureus</jats:italic>\n            , both media performed better after 24 h than after 48 h. The sensitivities at 24 h were comparable (CSA, 98.6%; ORSAB, 97.1%), but the specificity of CSA was significantly higher (CSA, 97.1%; ORSAB, 92.1%). For screening of methicillin resistance, antibiotic supplements were added to both media. The sensitivity was lower after 24 h (CSA, 58.6%; ORSAB, 84.2%) and increased significantly after 48 h (CSA, 77.5%; ORSAB, 91.4%). At both time intervals ORSAB was significantly more sensitive than CSA. However, the specificities of both media were high after 24 h (CSA, 99.1%; ORSAB, 98.3%) and decreased significantly after 48 h of incubation (CSA, 94.7%; ORSAB, 95.5%). In conclusion, for identification of\n            <jats:italic>S. aureus</jats:italic>\n            , CSA is more accurate than ORSAB because of a significantly higher specificity. For screening of MRSA, ORSAB performs better than CSA, but the usefulness in clinical practice is limited because a significant number of strains are not detected.\n          </jats:p>",

Most of the strains were resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfomethoxazole.

All of the strains contained a middle-range plasmid (35 to 62 MDa) as well as a number of stable small plasmids, yielding mainly two plasmid profiles which were different from those of 4a and 4b strains. Conjugation and curing experiments suggested that the middle-range plasmids harbored a self-transferable multiple antibiotic resistance marker. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis of all of the tested strains yielded two types with numerous subtypes, whereas ribotyping yielded only two types which were completely different from those of types 4a and 4b.

Various templates including those derived from the HCV genome were evaluated by examining the early steps of de novo RNA synthesis. NS5B was shown to be able to produce an initiation dinucleotide product from templates as short as 4-mer and from the 3′-terminal sequences of both plus and minus strands of the HCV RNA genome. GMP, GDP, and guanosine were able to act as an initiating nucleotide in de novo RNA synthesis, indicating that the triphosphate moiety is not absolutely required by an initiating nucleotide. Significant amounts of the initiation product accumulated in de novo synthesis, and elongation from the dinucleotide was observed when large amounts of dinucleotide were available. This result suggests that NS5B, a template, and incoming nucleotides are able to form an initiation complex that aborts frequently by releasing the dinucleotide product before transition to an elongation complex. The transition is rate limiting. Furthermore, we discovered that the secondary structure of a template was not essential for de novo initiation and that 3′-terminal bases of a template conferred specificity in selection of an initiation site. Initiation can occur at the +1, +2, or +3 position numbered from the 3′ end of a template depending on base composition. Pyrimidine bases at any of the three positions are able to serve as an initiation site, while purine bases at the +2 and +3 positions do not support initiation. This result implies that HCV possesses an intrinsic ability to ensure that de novo synthesis is initiated from the +1 position and to maintain the integrity of the 3′ end of its genome. This assay system should be an important tool for investigating the detailed mechanism of de novo initiation by HCV NS5B as well as other viral RNA polymerases.</jats:p>",

Here, site-directed mutagenesis and carbohydrate analysis were used to define further the 2G12 epitope. Extensive alanine scanning mutagenesis showed that elimination of the N-linked carbohydrate attachment sequences associated with residues N295, N332, N339, N386, and N392 by N→A substitution produced significant decreases in 2G12 binding affinity to gp120\n            <jats:sub>JR-CSF</jats:sub>\n            . Further mutagenesis suggested that the glycans at N339 and N386 were not critical for 2G12 binding to gp120\n            <jats:sub>JR-CSF</jats:sub>\n            . Comparison of the sequences of isolates neutralized by 2G12 was also consistent with a lesser role for glycans attached at these positions. The mutagenesis studies provided no convincing evidence for the involvement of gp120 amino acid side chains in 2G12 binding. Antibody binding was inhibited when gp120 was treated with\n            <jats:italic>Aspergillus saitoi</jats:italic>\n            mannosidase, Jack Bean mannosidase, or endoglycosidase H, indicating that Manα1→2Man-linked sugars of oligomannose glycans on gp120 are required for 2G12 binding. Consistent with this finding, the binding of 2G12 to gp120 could be inhibited by monomeric mannose but not by galactose, glucose, or\n            <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>\n            -acetylglucosamine.

Competition experiments between 2G12 and the lectin cyanovirin for binding to gp120 showed that 2G12 only interacts with a subset of available Manα1→2Man-linked sugars. Consideration of all the data, together with inspection of a molecular model of gp120, suggests that the most likely epitope for 2G12 is formed from mannose residues contributed by the glycans attached to N295 and N332, with the other glycans playing an indirect role in maintaining epitope conformation.\n          </jats:p>",

This gp41 core structure consists of three C-terminal helices packed in an antiparallel manner into hydrophobic grooves on the surface of the N-terminal trimeric coiled coil. Alanine mutations that destabilize the N- and C-terminal interhelical packing interactions also reduce viral infectivity. Here we show that viruses bearing these mutations exhibit a marked potentiation of inhibition by peptides that make up the gp41 core. By contrast, these viruses are unchanged in their sensitivities to soluble CD4, the CXCR4 coreceptor ligand SDF-1α, and human anti-HIV immunoglobulin, reagents that impact the initial, receptor-induced conformational changes in the envelope glycoprotein. Our results support the notion that these alanine mutations specifically affect the conformational transition to the fusion-active gp41 structure. The mutations also increase viral sensitivity to the gp41-directed monoclonal antibody 2F5, suggesting that this broadly neutralizing antibody may also interfere with this transition. The conformational activation of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein likely represents a viable target for vaccine and antiviral drug development.</jats:p>",

An unidentified cellular proteinase acting at the VP1/2A junction releases the mature capsid protein VP1 from VP1-2A later in the morphogenesis process. Although these aspects of polyprotein processing are well characterized, the function of 2A is unknown. To study its role in the viral life cycle, we assessed the infectivity of synthetic, genome-length RNAs containing 11 different in-frame deletions in the 2A region. Deletions in the N-terminal 40% of 2A abolished infectivity, whereas deletions in the C-terminal 60% resulted in viruses with a small-focus replication phenotype. C-terminal deletions in 2A had no effect on RNA replication kinetics under one-step growth conditions, nor did they have an effect on capsid protein synthesis and 3C\n            <jats:sup>pro</jats:sup>\n            -mediated processing. However, C-terminal deletions in 2A altered the VP1/2A cleavage, resulting in accumulation of uncleaved VP1-2A precursor in virions and possibly accounting for a delay in the appearance of infectious particles with these mutants, as well as a fourfold decrease in specific infectivity of the virus particles.

Resulting hybridomas were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay against RCANBP virions and SU-A-immunoglobulin G immunoadhesin. One highly reactive hybridoma clone, mc8C5, was subcloned and tested in immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation (IP), and Western blotting assays. In all three assays, mc8C5-4 subgroup-specifically recognizes SR-A Env, through the SU domain, expressed from different vectors in both avian and mammalian cells. This multifunctionality is notable for a mouse monoclonal. We furthermore observed a preference for binding to terminally glycosylated Env over core-glycosylated Env precursor in IPs, suggesting that the epitope is at least partially conformational and dependent on glycosylation. Most importantly, we found mc8C5-4 inhibited Env function: in vitro, the monoclonal not only interferes with binding of the EnvA receptor, Tva, but it also blocks the Tva-induced conformational change required for activation of the fusion peptide, without inducing that change itself. Infection of Tva-expressing avian or mammalian cells by avian sarcoma and leukosis virus (ASLV) or EnvA-pseudotyped murine leukemia virus, respectively, is efficiently inhibited by mc8C5-4. The apparent interference of the monoclonal with the EnvA-Tva complex formation suggests that the epitope seen by mc8C5 overlaps with the receptor binding site. This is supported by the observation that mutations of basic residues in hr2 or of the downstream glycosylation site, which both impair Tva-binding to EnvA, have similar effects on the binding of mc8C5. Thus, anti-ASLV-SU-A mc8C5-4 proves to be a unique new immunoreagent that targets the receptor-binding site on a prototypical retroviral envelope.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\n          <jats:p>Adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV-2) integrates specifically into a site on human chromosome 19 (chr-19) called AAVS1. To study the kinetics and frequency of chr-19-specific integration after AAV infection, we developed a rapid, sensitive, and quantitative real-time PCR assay for AAV inverted terminal repeat-chr-19-specific junctions. Despite the known variability of junction sites, conditions were established that ensured reliable quantification of integration rates within hours after AAV infection. The overall integration frequency was calculated to peak at between 10 and 20% of AAV-infected, unselected HeLa cells. At least 1 in 1,000 infectious AAV-2 particles was found to integrate site specifically up to day 4 postinfection in the absence of selection. Chromosomal breakpoints within AAVS1 agreed with those found in latently infected clonal cell lines and transgenic animals. Use of this quantitative real-time PCR will greatly facilitate the study of the early steps of wild-type and recombinant AAV vector integration.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\n          <jats:p>It has been proposed that the ectodomain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp41 (e-gp41), involved in HIV entry into the target cell, exists in at least two conformations, a pre-hairpin intermediate and a fusion-active hairpin structure. To obtain more information on the structure-sequence relationship in e-gp41, we performed in silico a full single-amino-acid substitution analysis, resulting in a Fold Compatible Database (FCD) for each conformation. The FCD contains for each residue position in a given protein a list of values assessing the energetic compatibility (ECO) of each of the 20 natural amino acids at that position. Our results suggest that FCD predictions are in good agreement with the sequence variation observed for well-validated e-gp41 sequences. The data show that at a minECO threshold value of 5 kcal/mol, about 90% of the observed patient sequence variation is encompassed by the FCD predictions. Some inconsistent FCD predictions at N-helix positions packing against residues of the C helix suggest that packing of both peptides may involve some flexibility and may be attributed to an altered orientation of the C-helical domain versus the N-helical region. The permissiveness of sequence variation in the C helices is in agreement with FCD predictions. Comparison of N-core and triple-hairpin FCDs suggests that the N helices may impose more constraints on sequence variation than the C helices. Although the observed sequences of e-gp41 contain many multiple mutations, our method, which is based on single-point mutations, can predict the natural sequence variability of e-gp41 very well.</jats:p>",

The availability of infectious genomic molecular clones of both viruses will permit chimeric constructs to be tested for viability in animals. Studies in cells with parental and chimeric constructs would also be very useful for both basic research and drug discovery. For this purpose, a convenient host cell type supporting replication of in vitro-transcribed GBV-B RNA should be identified. We constructed a GBV-B subgenomic selectable replicon based on the sequence of a genomic molecular clone proved to sustain infection in tamarins. The corresponding in vitro-transcribed RNA was used to transfect the Huh7 human hepatoma cell line, and intracellular replication of transfected RNA was shown to occur, even though in a small percentage of transfected cells, giving rise to antibiotic-resistant clones. Sequence analysis of GBV-B RNA from some of those clones showed no adaptive mutations with respect to the input sequence, whereas the host cells sustained higher GBV-B RNA replication than the original Huh7 cells. The enhancement of replication depending on host cell was shown to be a feature common to the majority of clones selected. The replication of GBV-B subgenomic RNA was susceptible to inhibition by known inhibitors of HCV to a level similar to that of HCV subgenomic RNA.\n          </jats:p>",

The oligomeric structure of Env is maintained after cleavage in a Golgi compartment and transport to the surfaces of infected cells, where incorporation into budding virions takes place. Here, we use biophysical techniques to assess the oligomeric valency of virion-associated Env prior to fusion activation. Virion-associated Env oligomers were stabilized by chemical cross-linking prior to detergent extraction and were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography. Gel filtration revealed a single predominant oligomeric species, and sedimentation equilibrium analysis-derived mass values indicated a trimeric structure. Determination of the masses of individual Env molecules by scanning transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that virion-associated Env was trimeric, and a triangular morphology was observed in 20 to 30% of the molecules. These results, which firmly establish the oligomeric structure of human immunodeficiency virus virion-associated Env, parallel those of our previous analysis of the simian immunodeficiency virus Env.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\n          <jats:p>Cellular infection by cytomegalovirus (CMV) is associated with very early G-protein-mediated signal transduction and reprogramming of gene expression. Here we investigated the involvement of human CMV (HCMV)-encoded US27, US28, and UL33 receptors as well as murine CMV-encoded M33 transmembrane (7TM) receptors in host cell signaling mechanisms. HCMV-encoded US27 did not show any constitutive activity in any of the studied signaling pathways; in contrast, US28 and M33 displayed ligand-independent, constitutive signaling through the G protein q (Gq)/phospholipase C pathway. In addition, M33 and US28 also activated the transcription factor NF-κB as well as the cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) in a ligand-independent, constitutive manner. The use of specific inhibitors indicated that the p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase but not the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2-MAP kinase pathway is involved in M33- and US28-mediated CREB activation but not NF-κB activation. Interestingly, UL33—the HCMV-encoded structural homologue of M33—was only marginally constitutively active in the Gq/phospholipase C turnover and CREB activation assays and did not show any constitutive activity in the NF-κB pathway, where M33 and US28 were highly active. Hence, CMVs appear to have conserved mechanisms for regulating host gene transcription, i.e., constitutive activation of certain kinases and transcription factors through the constitutive activities of 7TM proteins. These data, together with the previous identification of the incorporation of such proteins in the viral envelope, suggest that these proteins could be involved in the very early reprogramming of the host cell during viral infection.</jats:p>",

    "title": "The Long Noncoding Region of the Human Parainfluenza Virus Type 1 F Gene Contributes to the Read-Through Transcription at the M-F Gene Junction",
    "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\n          <jats:p>\n            Sendai virus (SV) and human parainfluenza virus type 1 (hPIV1) have genomes consisting of nonsegmented negative-sense RNA in which the six genes are separated by well-conserved intergenic (IG) sequences and transcriptional start (S) and end signals. In hPIV1-infected cells, transcriptional termination at the M-F gene junction is ineffective; a large number of M-F read-through transcripts are produced (T. Bousse, T. Takimoto, K. G. Murti, and A. Portner, Virology\n            <jats:bold>232</jats:bold>\n            :44-52, 1997). In contrast, few M-F read-through transcripts are detected in SV-infected cells. Sequence analysis indicated that the hPIV1 IG and S sequences in the M-F junction differ from those of SV. Furthermore, the hPIV1 F gene contains an unusually long noncoding sequence. To identify the\n            <jats:italic>cis</jats:italic>\n            -acting elements that prevent transcriptional termination at the M-F junction, we rescued recombinant SV (rSVhMFjCG) in which its M-F gene junction was replaced by that of hPIV1. Cells infected with rSVhMFjCG produced an abundance of M-F read-through transcripts; this result indicated that the hPIV1 M-F junction is responsible for inefficient termination. When one or both of the IG and S sites in rSVhMFjCG were replaced by those of SV, the efficiency of transcriptional termination increased but not to the level observed in wild-type SV-infected cells. Deletion of most of the long noncoding region of the hPIV1 F gene in rSVhMFjCG in addition to the mutations in IG and S signals resulted in efficient termination that was equivalent to the level observed in wild-type virus-infected cells. Therefore, the long noncoding sequence of the hPIV1 F gene contains\n            <jats:italic>cis</jats:italic>\n            -acting element(s) that affects transcriptional termination. Our evaluation of the effect of inefficient transcriptional termination on viral replication in culture revealed that cells infected with rSVhMFjCG produced less F protein than cells infected with wild-type SV and that assembly of the recombinant SV in culture was less efficient. These phenotypes seem to be responsible for the extended survival of mice infected with rSVhMFjCG.\n          </jats:p>",

Although a mutant Mo-MLV RT lacking the C helix (ΔC RT) retains DNA polymerase activity on homopolymeric substrates and partial RNase H activity, reverse transcription of the viral RNA genome in vivo is defective. To identify the essential features of the C helix, a panel of Mo-MLV RT mutants was generated. Analyses of these mutant viruses revealed the importance of residues H594, I597, R601, and G602. The mutants were tested for their ability to synthesize viral DNA after acute infections and to form proper 5′ and 3′ viral DNA ends. The mutant RTs were tested in vitro for exogenous RT activity, minus-strand strong-stop DNA synthesis in endogenous RT reactions, nonspecific RNase H activity, and finally, proper cleavage at the polypurine tract-U3 junction. The R601A mutant was the most defective mutant both in vivo and in vitro and possessed very little RNase H activity. The H594A, I597A, and G602A mutants had significant reductions in RNase H activity and in their rates of viral replication. Many of the mutants formed improper viral DNA ends and were less efficient in PPT-U3 recognition and cleavage in vitro. The data show that the C helix plays a crucial role for overall RNase H cleavage activity. The data also suggest that the C helix may play an important role in polypurine tract recognition and proper formation of the plus-strand DNA's 5′ end.\n          </jats:p>",

The effects of dengue virus infection on the production of chemokines by human mast cells were examined. Elevated levels of secreted RANTES, MIP-1α, and MIP-1β, but not IL-8 or ENA-78, were observed following infection of KU812 or HMC-1 human mast cell-basophil lines.

Chemokine responses were not observed when mast cells were treated with UV-inactivated dengue virus in the presence or absence of human dengue virus-specific antibody. Neither antibody-enhanced dengue virus infection of the highly permissive U937 monocytic cell line nor adenovirus infection of mast cells induced a RANTES, MIP-1α, or MIP-1β response, demonstrating a selective mast cell response to dengue virus.

The crystal structures of two complexes [M(Pic)L](Pic)<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> (M = Sm, Y) have been determined, which reveal that the M(III) ions (M = Sm, Y) are encapsulated by the three chains of the ligand and nine-coordinated by the central nitrogen atom, three ether oxygen atoms and three carbonyl oxygen atoms from the ligand, and two oxygen atoms from the didentate coordinated picrate ion in both cases. The results show that L acts as a heptadentate ligand, forming a cup-like coordination structure to accommodate the rare earth ion. Both rare earth complexes have the similar coordinate modes in spite of different unit cells. </jats:p>",

However, malabsorption does not satisfactorily explain the pathophysiology and clinical course of many of the associated neurological disorders. Other mechanisms proposed include altered autoimmunity, heredity, and gluten toxicity. This review attempts to summarise the literature and suggests directions for future research.</jats:p>",

A multidisciplinary approach involving airphoto analysis, offshore geophysical surveys, sediment coring, and facies and diatom analyses was used in this study of the Nastapoka River delta. The delta has formed as a result of the fluvial erosion of emerged Quaternary sediments but is mainly subaqueous. Offshore, in the prodelta zone, the oldest deposits are glaciomarine, laid down when the ice front of the receding Laurentide ice sheet stood on the Nastapoka hills some 77006800 years BP. Lateral equivalents of this glaciomarine unit are presently exposed on land. The shallow-water platform of the delta shows a thin surficial unit of wave-worked sand that overlies fine-grained, deeper water deposits derived from erosion of clay soils in the river catchment a few centuries ago, probably during periods of intense thermokarst activity. As the isostatic uplift continues, the deltaic platform will gradually emerge and be incised by the river channel.</jats:p>",

The resulting ages are mainly in the range 349387 Ma, with five additional grains that yield probable ages ranging from ~906 to ~2643 Ma. These ages are similar to the ages of detrital zircons in Carboniferous and older rocks of the YukonTanana terrane, which lies directly east of the Taku terrane. In contrast, these ages are different from the ages of detrital zircon grains in the Alexander terrane to the west. The data are accordingly consistent with models in which the Taku terrane is a western component of the Stikine and YukonTanana terranes, and that this crustal fragment is separated by a fundamental tectonic boundary from rocks of the Alexander and Wrangellia terranes to the west.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> A population of young blacktip sharks (Carcharhinus limbatus) was monitored over three years to determine their mortality rates using a series of acoustic listening stations. Based on these data it was possible to use several mortality estimators, including indirect life history based methods and direct methods such as the Kaplan-Meier and SURVIV methods, to estimate natural, fishing, and total mortality. Kaplan-Meier (6191%) and SURVIV (6292%) methods provided nearly identical total mortality rates during the first six months of life. This agreement suggests that these estimates are accurate for this population. All natural and fishing mortality occurred within the first 15 weeks of the study. This suggests that young sharks are most vulnerable to all types of mortality during this period. Sharks that survived beyond the first 15 weeks successfully left the nursery and were presumed to have migrated southward during fall months. These results provide critical information concerning the early life history of sharks and the importance of nursery areas to the survival of young animals. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> A mutant strain of Pseudomonas putida (LU2201) expressing a novel ethylphenylacetate (EPA) esterase was isolated after mutagenesis of P. putida LU6456. The DNA fragment conferring the EPA<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> phenotype was cloned and characterized. It included the structural genes of the 2,3-butanediol catabolic pathway, including acoC, which catalyzes the acetyl transfer step (i.e., dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase). The acoC gene product from LU2201 was expressed in E. coli and shown to be responsible for the novel EPA-esterase activity. Biochemical characterization revealed that the enzyme still retained the natural dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase activity. Sequence comparison with the corresponding wild-type gene indicated a single-base pair change leading to a I238V replacement in the respective protein. Biochemical characterization of wild-type AcoC enzyme showed that it too was able to catalyze EPA hydrolysis despite the apparent absence of this activity in cells grown in the presence of EPA. Unlike the wild type, EPA serves as an inducer in the mutant strain. Inverse PCR was used to clone the putative regulator acoR from the aco operon in both wild type and mutant strains.

Clear evidence of structural enhancement of the network is obtained in dilute solutions as well as destruction of the network by hydrophobic interactions as the concentration is increased.

A number of vasoactive mediators and growth factors have been reported to participate in this process. The aim of the present experiments was to examine the effects of nonselective neutral endopeptidase (NEPi)/endothelin-converting enzyme (ECEi) inhibitors against neointimal proliferation (NIP) following balloon angioplasty of the left carotid artery of SpragueDawley rats with the right vessel serving as the uninjured control. The rats were divided in several groups: group 1, nontreated (vehicle); group 2, treated with a selective NEPi i.p.; groups 37, treated with nonselective NEPi/ECEi either i.p., s.c., i.v., or p.o. at various doses. After 2 weeks, cross-sectional histopathological and morphometrical examination of the left carotids revealed a severe NIP in vehicle-treated angioplastic rats compared with the control uninjured right carotid of the same rats.

In this paper, we introduce the notion of distributed automata in the sequential sense. Distributed Automata are a group of automata working in unison to accept one language. We build the theory of distributed for FSA and PDA in different modes of acceptance like the t-mode, *-mode, =k-mode, ≤k-mode and ≥k-mode. We then analyze the acceptance power of each automata in all the above modes. We present proofs that distributed FSAs do not have any additional power over \"centralized\" FSAs in any of the modes, while distributed PDAs with only two components are as powerful as Turing Machines in all of the modes. We give proofs for the equivalence of all modes in the case of PDAs. We also study a restricted version of distributed PDA called k-turn distributed PDA. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The purpose of this paper is to investigate the quantum vacua directly implied by the wave function of a gravitational configuration characterized by the presence of an apparent horizon, namely the Vaidya space–time solution. Spherical symmetry is a main feature of this configuration, with a scalar field constituting a source [a Klein–Gordon geon or Berger–Chitre–Moncrief–Nutku (BCMN) type model]. The subsequent analysis requires solving a Wheeler–DeWitt equation near the apparent horizon (following the guidelinesintroduced by A. Tomimatsu,<jats:sup>18</jats:sup>; M. Pollock,<jats:sup>19</jats:sup> and developed by A. Hosoya and I. Oda<jats:sup>20,21</jats:sup>) with the scalar field herein expanded in terms of S<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> spherical harmonics: midisuperspace quantization. The main results present in this paper are as follows. It is found that the mass function characteristic of the Vaidya metric is positive definite within this quantum approach. Furthermore, the inhomogeneous matter sector determines a descrip-tion in terms of open quantum (sub)systems, namely in the form of an harmonic oscillator whose frequency depends on the mass function. For this open (sub)system, a twofold approach is employed. On the one hand, an exact invariant observable is obtained from the effective Hamiltonian for the inhomogeneous matter modes. It is shown that this invariant admits a set of discrete eigenvalues which depend on the mass function. The corresponding set of eigenstates is constructed from a particular vacuum state. On the other hand, exact solutions are found for the Schrädinger equation associated with the inhomogeneous matter modes. This paper is concluded with a discussion, where two other issues are raised: (i) the possible application to realistic black hole dynamics of the results obtained for a simplified (BCMN) model and (ii) whether such vacuum states could be related with others defined instead within scalar field theories constructed in classical backgrounds. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Amorphous alloys can be modelled as random networks of atoms or molecules of differing valencies. A statistical-mechanical theory of such networks is presented for the case of binary amorphous alloys. The existence of a continuous equilibrium phase transition, from the liquid state to the amorphous solid state driven by increasing the density of permanent random covalent bonds, is demonstrated. The structural and elastic properties of the amorphous solid state are calculated through the use of a variational Ansatz, and a discussion is given of the dependence of these properties on the relative concentration of the constituent atoms or molecules and their valencies. Implications of the present results in the context of gelation are addressed, especially with regard to the (primarily entropic) elastic properties of gels. </jats:p>",

The first part of the algorithm required the systematic enumeration of all discs which support a 'braid foliation' and are embeddable in 3-space. The boundaries of these 'foliated embeddable discs' (FED's) are the collection of all closed braid representatives of the unknot, up to conjugacy, and the second part of the algorithm produces a word in the generators of the braid group which represents the boundary of the previously listed FED's. The third part tests whether a given closed braid is conjugate to the boundary of a FED on the list. In this paper we describe implementations of the first and second parts of the algorithm. We also give some of the data which we obtained. The data suggests that FED's have unexplored and interesting structure. Open question are interspersed throughout the manuscript. The third part of the algorithm was studied in [3] and [4], and implemented by S. J. Lee [20]. At this writing his algorithm is polynomial for n ≤ 4 and exponential for n ≥ 5. </jats:p>",

Stabilization funds have long been used by many countries to achieve the goal of market stabilization. However, the actual impacts of the funds still remain a puzzle. This is the first paper that empirically examines the effect of the stabilization fund on the stock market. Taiwan's stock stabilization fund, which was inaugurated in February 1996 after the panic selling induced by the announcement of military exercise by mainland China, provides an experimental environment for investigating whether this alternative mechanism is effective in stabilizing the stock price when the market is in panic. By intervention analysis, we find that in the short run, the stabilization fund is statistically significant in preventing the market price from further declining after the announcement of the mainland China's military exercise. This evidence still holds after controlling the effects of the following two events: Morgan-Stanley's announcement to include Taiwan stock index into its worldwide equity market indices, and the event of U.S. aircraft carrier sent to Taiwan Strait to secure this area during the period of military exercise by mainland China. </jats:p>",

In particular, all points on the approximation are guaranteed to be within some user-specified distance from the original surface. Such bounds are notably absent from many current simplification methods, and are becoming increasingly important for applications in scientific computing and adaptive level of detail control. Conceptually simple, the permission grid defines a volume in which the approximation must lie, and does not permit the underlying simplification algorithm to generate approximations outside the volume.The permission grid makes three important, practical improvements over current error-bounded simplification methods. First, it works on arbitrary triangular models, handling all manners of mesh degeneracies gracefully. Further, the error tolerance may be easily expanded as simplification proceeds, allowing the construction of an error-bounded level of detail hierarchy with vertex correspondences among all levels of detail. And finally, the permission grid has a representation complexity independent of the size of the input model, and a small running time overhead, making it more practical and efficient than current methods with similar guarantees.</jats:p>",

The available outline of the human genome contains 48 ABC genes; 16 of these have a known function and 14 are associated with a defined human disease. Major physiological functions of ABC transporters include the transport of lipids, bile salts, toxic compounds, and peptides for antigen presentation or other purposes. We review the functions of mammalian ABC transporters, emphasizing biochemical mechanisms and genetic defects. Our overview illustrates the importance of ABC transporters in human physiology, toxicology, pharmacology, and disease. We focus on three topics: (a) ABC transporters transporting drugs (xenotoxins) and drug conjugates. (b) Mammalian secretory epithelia using ABC transporters to excrete a large number of substances, sometimes against a steep concentration gradient. Several inborn errors in liver metabolism are due to mutations in one of the genes for these pumps; these are discussed. (c) A rapidly increasing number of ABC transporters are found to play a role in lipid transport. Defects in each of these transporters are involved in human inborn or acquired diseases.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>▪ Abstract  The first crystal structures of intact T cell receptors (TCRs) bound to class I peptide-MHC (pMHCs) antigens were determined in 1996. Since then, further structures of class I TCR/pMHC complexes have explored the degree of structural variability in the TCR-pMHC system and the structural basis for positive and negative selection. The recent determination of class II and allogeneic class I TCR/pMHC structures, as well as those of accessory molecules (e.g., CD3), has pushed our knowledge of TCR/pMHC interactions into new realms, shedding light on clinical pathologies, such as graft rejection and graft-versus-host disease. Furthermore, the determination of coreceptor structures lays the foundation for a more comprehensive structural description of the supramolecular TCR signaling events and those assemblies that arise in the immunological synapse. While these telling photodocumentaries of the TCR/pMHC interaction are composed mainly from static crystal structures, a full description of the biological snapshots in T cell signaling requires additional analytical methods that record the dynamics of the process. To this end, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and ultracentrifugation (UC) have furnished both affinities and kinetics of the TCR/pMHC association. In the past year, structural, biochemical, and molecular biological data describing TCR/pMHC interactions have sublimely coalesced into a burgeoning well of understanding that promises to deliver further insights into T cell recognition. The coming years will, through a more intimate union of structural and kinetic data, allow many pressing questions to be addressed, such as how TCR/pMHC ligation is affected by coreceptor binding and what is the mechanism of TCR signaling in both early and late stages of T cell engagement with antigen-presenting cells.</jats:p>",

During the past 15 years considerable effort has been expended in trying to establish the genetic loci associated with susceptibility to these and other mental disorders using principally linkage analysis. Despite this, only a handful of specific genes have been identified, and it is now generally recognized that further advances along these lines will require the analysis of literally hundreds of affected individuals and their families. Fortunately, the emergence in the past three years of a number of new approaches and more effective tools has given new hope to those engaged in the search for the underlying genetic and environmental factors involved in causing these illnesses, which collectively are among the most serious in all societies. Chief among these new tools is the availability of the entire human genome sequence and the prospect that within the next several years the entire complement of human genes will be known and the functions of most of their protein products elucidated. In the meantime the search for susceptibility loci is being facilitated by the availability of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and by the beginning of haplotype mapping, which tracks the distribution of clusters of SNPs that segregate as a group. Together with high throughput DNA sequencing, microarrays for whole genome scanning, advances in proteomics, and the development of more sophisticated computer programs for analyzing sequence and association data, these advances hold promise of greatly accelerating the search for the genetic basis of most mental illnesses while, at the same time, providing molecular targets for the development of new and more effective therapies.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> ▪ Abstract  Electron transfer between a molecular resonance and a metal surface is a ubiquitous process in many chemical disciplines, ranging from molecular electronics to surface photochemistry. This problem has been probed recently by two-photon photoemission spectroscopy. The first photon excites an electron from an occupied metal state to an unoccupied molecular resonance. Subsequent evolution of the excited electronic wavefunction is probed in energy, momentum, and time domains by the absorption of a second photon, which ionizes the electron for detection. These experiments reveal the important roles of molecule-metal wavefunction mixing, intermolecular band formation, polarization, and localization in interfacial electron transfer. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Ethnic Boundaries and Identity in Plural Societies",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>▪ Abstract  This paper reviews studies of ethnicity in plural societies. The literature concentrates on the social networks of ethnic groups, the use of social capital derived from these networks, and ethnic identity. I give particular attention to studies that consider how interpersonal networks within ethnic communities influence the degree of closure in social boundaries and the degree to which ethnic identity is retained. Most of the studies considered here have been published during the past two decades. However, a few earlier studies are considered so as to frame recent work in an appropriate context. Two main research foci characterize contemporary studies—forms of economic action undertaken by the immigrant generation and the socialization experiences of their offspring. Related areas of study also addressed in this review include how participation in ethnic churches, metropolitan and regional concentrations of ethnic populations, and transnationalism influence ethnic groups' experiences. I conclude by suggesting a few directions for future research.</jats:p>",

    "title": "The Study of Islamic Culture and Politics: An Overview and Assessment",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>▪ Abstract  Among the four major world cultural traditions—Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, and Christianity—Islam appears to have the most pervasive role in contemporary politics. The vast and varied spectrum of the scholarly works that have addressed this distinctive phenomenon started with a tradition that presumed a conflict between Islam and political modernity, while noting the centrality and universality of the faith for Muslims. This conception runs contrary to the admission of the reality of secular politics in historical Islam. If there is, on the contrary, a congruity between Islam and modernity, one still needs to provide an account of the speecificity of Muslim politics. Addressing this issue, another tradition stressed that because of its very survival into the modern era, the great Islamic tradition can play a significant role in political modernization and nation building. While this argument may be true in the cases of the historical experiences of a number of Islamic countries in the early twentieth century, it is not consistent with the overly transnational and other worldly objectives of radical Islamism of late. A third tradition opted for the analysis of the macro social processes in order to account for the rise of political Islam, while a fourth focused on the micro processes of the objectification of religion and the fragmentation of religious authority to explain Muslim politics. These explanations, however, would be incomplete without a serious assessment of the role of the rentier economy in the rise of Muslim exceptionalism. Following a critical assessment of the extant literature, this essay makes several suggestions for future research.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Barking up the Wrong Branch: Scientific Alternatives to the Current Model of Sociological Science",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>A fortiori it is unlikely that a mere repetition of the tricks which served us so well in physics will do for the social phenomena too. (John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern 1944, p. 6) I do not think the relationship between theory and measurement in the social sciences is much like what Kuhn describes for physics. Talcott Parsons was right about the lack of interaction between the two in sociology. If Kuhn is right about the preconditions for such interaction in physics, and if physics is the model for sociology, then it will be a long time before measurement makes an important contribution to sociology as a basic science …. But sociology is not like physics. Nothing but physics is like physics …. (Otis Dudley Duncan 1984, p. 169)</jats:p><jats:p>▪ Abstract  The standard for what passes as scientific sociology is derived from classical physics, a model of natural science that is totally inappropriate for sociology. As a consequence, we pursue goals and use criteria for success that are harmful and counterproductive. Even those dismissing such efforts use the standards of physics as grounds for their objection. Although recognizing that no natural science can serve as an automatic template for our work, we suggest that Darwin's work on evolution provides a far more applicable model for linking theory and research since he dealt with obstacles far more similar to our own. This includes drawing rigorous conclusions based on observational data rather than true experiments; an ability to absorb enormous amounts of diverse data into a relatively simple system that did not include a large number of what we think of as independent variables; the absence of prediction as a standard for evaluating the adequacy of a theory; and the ability to use a theory that is incomplete in both the evidence that supports it and in its development. Other sciences are briefly cited as well, but the main emphasis is on the lessons that Darwin provides for social sciences such as sociology that obtain their evidence primarily from non-experimental sources.</jats:p>",

We studied the hypothesis that nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), a transcription factor, is necessary for metalloproteinase secretion and, hence, is a target for pharmacological intervention. Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of the inhibitory NF-κB subunit, I-κ Bα, was achieved into human monocyte-derived macrophages in vitro and into foam cells produced in vivo in cholesterol-fed rabbits.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>\n            The thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) is a recently described inhibitor of fibrinolysis that decreases plasminogen binding to the fibrin surface. The plasma TAFI concentration is almost entirely genetically determined. We investigated whether plasma TAFI levels and polymorphisms located in the TAFI gene could constitute risk markers of myocardial infarction (MI). Plasma TAFI antigen (Ag) levels were assayed by ELISA and 2 TAFI gene polymorphisms (Ala147Thr and C+1542G in the 3′ untranslated region) were determined in a large European case-control study. This study compared 598 men recruited 3 to 6 months after MI with 653 age-matched controls from North Europe (Stockholm, Sweden, and London, England) and South Europe (Marseilles, France, and San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy). A TAFI Ag value above the 90th percentile was associated with a significantly lower risk of MI (odds ratio 0.55,\n            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>\n            &lt;0.02), indicating that elevated TAFI may be protective against MI. As previously shown, the 2 TAFI gene polymorphisms were in strong linkage disequilibrium and were associated with the TAFI Ag concentration, with carriers of the Thr147 and 1542C alleles having higher levels (\n            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>\n            &lt;0.0005). These effects were similar in controls and cases and in each center. There was a difference in allele frequency between cases and controls for the Ala147Thr polymorphism, with Thr147 allele carriers being more frequent in controls than in cases in 2 centers, Stockholm (\n            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>\n            =0.03) and San Giovanni Rotondo (\n            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>\n            =0.03); the odds ratio for the entire cohort was 0.78 (\n            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>\n            &lt;0.05). In conclusion, patients with a recent MI presented lower values of TAFI Ag and higher frequencies of the “TAFI-decreasing” alleles.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Viral and bacterial infectious agents have been implicated in the etiology of atherosclerosis. We have previously shown that a γ-herpesvirus can accelerate atherosclerosis in the apolipoprotein E–deficient (apoE−/−) mouse. To address whether a virally induced systemic immune response is sufficient to trigger enhanced atheroma formation, we infected apoE−/− mice with murine γ-herpesvirus-68 (MHV-68) or herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1). In this study, we show that both viruses were able to induce a cell-mediated and humoral immune response in the apoE−/− mouse, which was sustained over a period of 24 weeks. Although intranasal or intraperitoneal infection with MHV-68 induced similar levels of virus-specific IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies in the serum of apoE−/− mice, those infected with HSV-1 showed higher anti–HSV-1 IgG2a compared with IgG1 antibody levels. In addition, viral message was not detected in the aortas of HSV-1–infected animals, whereas we have shown previously that MHV-68 mRNA can be detected in the aortas of infected mice as early as 5 days after infection. Compared with control mice, apoE−/− mice infected with MHV-68 showed accelerated atherosclerosis, whereas mice infected with HSV-1 did not. These data indicate that a systemic immune response to any particular infectious agent is insufficient to induce enhanced atherosclerosis in the apoE−/− mouse and point to specific infections or immune mechanisms that might be essential for virally enhanced atherogenesis.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>\n            Vulnerable plaque generally contains a thin fibrous cap, lipid pools, and reduced internal plaque collagen. Arterial fluorescence analysis can differentiate atherosclerotic lesions from normal arteries; however, the contribution of the lipid core to atherosclerotic arterial fluorescence remains controversial. This study aimed to identify lipid core fluorophores and to differentiate the lipid core from normal artery and atheroma. The helium-cadmium laser–induced fluorescence spectra of cadaveric arteries and known chemical constituents were recorded. Lipid core fluorescence spectra exhibited marked red shifts and broadening compared with the fluorescence spectra of normal tissue and atheroma. Similar fluorescence spectra were obtained for lipid core and oxidized low density lipoprotein, for atheroma and collagen, and for normal artery and elastin. A classification based on collagen, elastin, and oxidized low density lipoprotein spectral decomposition could discriminate the lipid core (n=29), normal artery (n=74), atheroma (n=73), and preatheroma (n=10) with 86% accuracy. Fibrous cap thickness was correlated with the spectral collagen content index (\n            <jats:italic>r</jats:italic>\n            =0.65,\n            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>\n            &lt;0.0001), especially at a thickness of &lt;200 μm.

Recently, propagermanium, a drug used clinically for the treatment of chronic hepatitis in Japan, has been shown to inhibit C-C chemokine receptor 2 function and suppress monocyte/macrophage infiltration in vitro and in vivo. Given the importance of monocyte infiltration in atherogenesis, the inhibition of it by propagermanium might prevent atherosclerosis. Apolipoprotein E knockout (apoE-KO) mice were fed an atherogenic high cholesterol diet with or without 0.005% propagermanium for 8 or 12 weeks. Although the plasma lipid levels were unchanged by the drug treatment, atherosclerotic lesion area in the aortic root was reduced by 50% in the drug-treated apoE-KO mice compared with the nontreated apoE-KO mice after 8 weeks of cholesterol feeding (0.62±0.12 versus 1.27±0.07 mm\n            <jats:sup>2</jats:sup>\n            , respectively;\n            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>\n            &lt;0.01).

In SMCs transiently transfected with SHP2, FBS stimulation significantly increased bromodeoxyuridine uptake beyond the uptake by control SMCs.\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>\n              <jats:italic>\n                <jats:bold>\n                  <jats:italic>Conclusions</jats:italic>\n                </jats:bold>\n                —\n              </jats:italic>\n            </jats:bold>\n            Increased SHP2 expression in SMCs may accelerate aortic atherosclerosis by increasing cell growth.\n          </jats:p>",

Thus, we examined the feasibility of therapeutic angiogenesis by using HGF, with the goal of progression to human gene therapy. Intramuscular injection of HGF plasmid resulted in a significant increase in blood flow even in Lp(a) transgenic mice, accompanied by the detection of human HGF protein. A significant increase in capillary density also was detected in Lp(a) transgenic mice transfected with human HGF compared with control (\n            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>\n            &lt;0.01).\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>\n              <jats:italic>Conclusions—</jats:italic>\n            </jats:bold>\n            Overall, a high serum Lp(a) concentration impaired collateral formation.

Its timing coincided with posterior LAA activation, shown to be immediately adjacent to the left superior PV by angiography. In the left inferior PV, the first potential was smaller and less sharp, coinciding with adjacent low LA activation. Angiographically, the LAA was at least 15 mm from the left inferior PV.

We estimated the impact of using cardiovascular disease risk on treatment recommendations for the US population using data from 16 527 participants in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. In the US population ≥20 years of age, 36% (62 million) had high-normal blood pressure or greater (systolic/diastolic blood pressure ≥130 mm Hg/≥85 mm Hg) or were taking antihypertensive medication. Of this population, 5.1% (3.2 million) were stratified into risk group A (no cardiovascular disease risk factors or prevalent cardiovascular disease), 66.3% (41.4 million) into risk group B (≥1 major risk factor), and 28.6% (17.9 million) into risk group C (diabetes mellitus, clinical cardiovascular disease, target organ damage). Also, 26% of this group (16.2 million) had high-normal blood pressure and were in risk groups A or B, a context in which vigorous lifestyle modification is recommended in the JNC-VI guidelines. Additionally, 11% (7.0 million) had high-normal blood pressure (systolic/diastolic, 130 to 139 mm Hg/85 to 89 mm Hg, respectively) or stage-1 hypertension (140 to 159 mm Hg/90 to 99 mm Hg), and at least 1 factor, placing them in risk group C, but they were not currently on antihypertensive medication.

We investigated the effects of acute physical exercise on insulin sensitivity in 10 hypertensive and 10 normotensive subjects during a control evaluation (CTRL), during lower body negative pressure (LBNP), after 30 minutes of mild bicycle exercise (POSTEX), and during LBNP after exercise (POSTEX+LBNP).

Cardiac output (4.9±0.3 versus 5.3±0.4 L/min, mean±SEM) and insulin sensitivity (the glucose disappearance rate over insulin area under the curve: 0.91±0.07 versus 1.38±0.25 min\n            <jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>\n            /[pmol · L\n            <jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>\n            ] · minute) were lower (both\n            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>\n            &lt;0.05) in hypertensive than in normotensive subjects, respectively. Cardiac output decreased during LBNP, increased during POSTEX, and was similar to control during POSTEX+LBNP in both groups. Insulin sensitivity was unchanged during LBNP, increased during POSTEX, and remained elevated during POSTEX+LBNP in hypertensive subjects, whereas it remained unchanged in normotensives. Peak forearm blood flow was significantly lower in hypertensive than in normotensive subjects, despite higher insulin levels in hypertensives, and was not modified by LBNP or exercise. In conclusion, insulin sensitivity increases after exercise in hypertensive subjects, and the increase in cardiac output does not contribute to this effect. Endogenous insulin-induced vasodilatation is reduced in hypertensive subjects, and this insulin action is not affected by physical exercise.\n          </jats:p>",

    "title": "Brain Sodium Channels Mediate Increases in Brain “Ouabain” and Blood Pressure in Dahl S Rats",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>\n            Central infusions of benzamil prevent/reverse salt-induced hypertension in genetic models of salt-sensitive hypertension. Benzamil acts by blockade of ion—presumably sodium—channels. In the present study, we assessed in Dahl salt-sensitive (S) rats on high salt intake whether these channels mediate increases in brain “ouabain” and, thereby, hypertension. Intracerebroventricular (icv) infusions of a low (1.2 μg/kg per hour) or high (4.0 μg/kg per hour) dose of benzamil were given to Dahl S rats on high salt diet (1370 μmol Na\n            <jats:sup>+</jats:sup>\n            /g food) for 2 or 4 weeks. “Ouabain” content was measured using a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Systolic blood pressure (BP) in Dahl S rats on high salt for 4 weeks increased markedly (188±10 versus 128±4 mm Hg, n=8,\n            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>\n            &lt;0.05). Benzamil fully blocked this increase (131±7 mm Hg after the high dose of benzamil). Hypothalamic and pituitary “ouabain” increased significantly (22±7 versus 12±3 and 151±38 versus 69±6 ng/g tissue, respectively,\n            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>\n            &lt;0.05) in Dahl S rats on high salt versus regular salt diet for 2 weeks. Benzamil blocked these increases of brain “ouabain” to high salt intake. Similarly, high salt intake for 4 weeks increased hypothalamic (18±2 versus 13±1 ng/g tissue,\n            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>\n            &lt;0.05) and pituitary (183±30 versus 78±8 ng/g tissue,\n            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>\n            &lt;0.05) “ouabain.” Benzamil also inhibited these increases of brain “ouabain.” Both hypothalamic and pituitary “ouabain” showed significant positive correlations with BP. In contrast, high salt intake did not affect “ouabain” levels in the adrenal gland or plasma in Dahl S rats on high salt for either 2 or 4 weeks. These findings indicate that in Dahl S rats high salt intake only increases brain and not peripheral “ouabain” and that benzamil-blockable brain sodium channels mediate the increases in brain “ouabain” and the subsequent hypertension.\n          </jats:p>",

We have previously reported that short-term inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) ameliorates β-adrenergic hyporesponsiveness in TG mice. To examine whether long-term inhibition of iNOS may rescue TG mice from developing congestive heart failure, we disrupted iNOS gene by crossing TG mice with iNOS knockout mice. Myocardial levels of iNOS protein were significantly increased in TG mice compared with age- and sex-matched wild-type (WT) mice. No iNOS protein was detected in TG mice with the disruption of iNOS. Myocardial levels of endothelial NOS were not different among these mice. To examine the effects of iNOS disruption on myocardial contractility, left ventricular pressure was measured. In TG mice, +dP/dt\n            <jats:sub>max</jats:sub>\n            was significantly suppressed, and its β-adrenergic responsiveness was blunted. As in the case with short-term inhibition of iNOS, the disruption of iNOS gene improved β-adrenergic inotropic responsiveness in TG mice but not in WT mice. However, the iNOS disruption did not alter myocardial inflammation, ventricular hypertrophy, or the survival of these mice. These results indicate that although myocardial expression of iNOS plays a key role in the attenuation of β-adrenergic inotropic responsiveness, NO-independent mechanisms might be more important in the development of congestive heart failure.\n          </jats:p>",

Immunohistochemistry of IκBα revealed that mainly smooth muscle cells of the media but also cells of the adventitia were transduced and expressed the transgene IκBα for ≥8 days. At this time point, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (30%) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (50%) expression, as well as recruitment of macrophages into the wounded area (90%), were significantly reduced in IκBα-treated vessels. In addition, expression of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins was reduced and the percentage of apoptotic cells was increased compared with control-treated contralateral vessels. Animals killed 5 weeks after treatment exhibited a significantly reduced degree of lumen narrowing (\n            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>\n            &lt;0.02) on the side treated with adenovirus IκBα.

These data show for the first time that inflammation mediated by NF-κB is involved in postangioplasty lumen narrowing. Specific and more potent inhibitors of NF-κB might therefore be a useful therapeutic measure to improve clinical outcome after balloon dilatation.\n          </jats:p>",

However, there is a significant loss of vestibular function with aging. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to determine if young and older individuals differ in their cardiovascular and sympathetic responses to otolithic stimulation (ie, head-down rotation, HDR). We hypothesized that responses to otolithic stimulation would be attenuated in older adults because of morphological and physiological alterations that occur in the vestibular system with aging.\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>\n              <jats:italic>\n                <jats:bold>\n                  <jats:italic>Methods and Results</jats:italic>\n                </jats:bold>\n                —\n              </jats:italic>\n            </jats:bold>\n            Arterial blood pressure, heart rate, muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), and head rotation were measured during HDR in 11 young (26±1 years) and 11 older (64±1 years) subjects in the prone posture. Five older subjects performed head rotation (chin to chest) in the lateral decubitus position, which simulates HDR but does not alter afferent inputs from the vestibular system. MSNA responses to HDR were significantly attenuated in older as compared with young subjects (\n            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>\n            &lt;0.01). MSNA increased in the older subjects by only 12±5% as compared with 85±16% in the young.

Both HGF and c-met are expressed by vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells, where HGF may exert autocrine and paracrine effects. We have found that human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) release a soluble, truncated form of c-met. Receptor shedding was induced by treatment of the cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and by the ligand, HGF. Shedding was inhibited by cycloheximide, a metalloproteinase inhibitor, and protein kinase C inhibitors. The soluble form of c-met was able to bind HGF, although with reduced affinity (K\n            <jats:sub>d</jats:sub>\n            ≈10 nmol/L) compared with the membrane bound receptor.

The NCX1H1 promoter was sufficient for driving the normal spatiotemporal pattern of NCX1 expression in cardiac development. The luciferase reporter gene was expressed in a heart-restricted pattern both in early embryos (embryonic days 8 to 14) and in later embryos (after embryonic day 14), when NCX1 is also expressed in other tissues. In the adult, no luciferase activity was detected in the kidney, liver, spleen, uterus, or skeletal muscle; minimal activity was detected in the brain; and very high levels of luciferase expression were detected in the heart. Transverse aortic constriction–operated mice showed significantly increased left ventricular mass after 7 days. In addition, there was a 2-fold upregulation of NCX1H1 promoter activity in the left ventricle in animals after 7 days of pressure overload compared with both control and sham-operated animals. This work demonstrates that the NCX1H1 promoter directs cardiac-specific expression of the exchanger in both the embryo and adult and is also sufficient for the upregulation of NCX1 in response to pressure overload.\n          </jats:p>",

Whereas cardiomyocyte-specific AT\n            <jats:sub>1</jats:sub>\n            receptor expression produces cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling in vivo, delineation of the signals that mediate growth to Ang II is challenging because the prevailing in vitro model (cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes) expresses low levels of AT\n            <jats:sub>1</jats:sub>\n            receptor and responds inconsistently to Ang II. In this study, when AT\n            <jats:sub>1A</jats:sub>\n            receptors were expressed using adenovirus in cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes, Ang II stimulated a robust hypertrophy that was not secondary to the release of cardiac fibroblast-derived factors, specifically endothelin-1.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>\n            p38 Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is one of the most ancient signaling molecules and is involved in multiple cellular processes, including cell proliferation, cell growth, and cell death. In the heart, enhanced activation of p38 MAPK is associated with ischemia/reperfusion injury and the onset of heart failure. In the present study, we investigated the function of p38 MAPK in regulating cardiac contractility and its underlying mechanisms. In cultured adult rat cardiomyocytes, activation of p38 MAPK by adenoviral gene transfer of an activated mutant of its upstream kinase, MKK3bE, led to a significant reduction in baseline contractility, compared with uninfected cells or those infected with a control adenoviral vector (Adv-β-galactosidase). The inhibitory effect of MKK3bE on contractility was largely prevented by coexpressing a dominant-negative mutant of p38 MAPK or treating cells with a p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580. Conversely, inhibition of endogenous p38 MAPK activity by SB203580 rapidly and reversibly enhanced cell contractility in a dose-dependent manner, without altering L-type Ca\n            <jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>\n            currents or Ca\n            <jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>\n            <jats:sub>i</jats:sub>\n            transients. MKK3bE-induced p38 activation had no significant effect on pH\n            <jats:sub>i</jats:sub>\n            , whereas SB203580 had a minor effect to elevate pH\n            <jats:sub>i</jats:sub>\n            . Furthermore, activation of p38 MAPK was unable to increase troponin I phosphorylation. Thus, we conclude that the negative inotropic effect of p38 MAPK is mediated by decreasing myofilament response to Ca\n            <jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>\n            , rather than by altering Ca\n            <jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>\n            <jats:sub>i</jats:sub>\n            homeostasis and that the reduced myofilament Ca\n            <jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>\n            sensitivity is unlikely attributable to troponin I phosphorylation or alterations in pH\n            <jats:sub>i</jats:sub>\n            . These findings reveal a novel function of p38 MAPK and shed a new light on our understanding of the coincidence of p38 MAPK activation and the onset of heart failure.\n          </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>\n            Inhibition of xanthine oxidase (XO) in failing hearts improves cardiac efficiency by an unknown mechanism. We hypothesized that this energetic effect is due to reduced oxidative stress and critically depends on nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity, reflecting a balance between generation of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species. In dogs with pacing-induced heart failure (HF), ascorbate (1000 mg) mimicked the beneficial energetic effects of allopurinol, increasing both contractility and efficiency, suggesting an antioxidant mechanism. Allopurinol had no additive effect beyond that of ascorbate. Crosstalk between XO and NOS signaling was assessed. NOS inhibition with\n            <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>\n            <jats:sup>G</jats:sup>\n            -monomethyl-\n            <jats:sc>l</jats:sc>\n            -arginine (L-NMMA; 20 mg/kg) had no effect on basal contractility or efficiency in HF, but prevented the +26.2±3.5% and +66.5±17% enhancements of contractility and efficiency, respectively, observed with allopurinol alone. Similarly, improvements in contractility and energetics due to ascorbate were also inhibited by L-NMMA. Because of the observed NOS-XO crosstalk, we predicted that in normal hearts NOS inhibition would uncover a depression of energetics caused by XO activity. In normal conscious dogs, L-NMMA increased myocardial oxygen consumption (MV̇O\n            <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\n            ) while lowering left ventricular external work, reducing efficiency by 31.1±3.8% (\n            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>\n            &lt;0.005). Lowered efficiency was reversed by XO inhibition (allopurinol, 200 mg) or by ascorbate without affecting cardiac load or systemic hemodynamics. Single-cell immunofluorescence detected XO protein in cardiac myocytes that was enhanced in HF, consistent with autocrine signaling. These data show that both NOS and XO signaling systems participate in the regulation of myocardial mechanical efficiency and that upregulation of XO relative to NOS contributes to mechanoenergetic uncoupling in heart failure.\n          </jats:p>",

Decreased NO and/or increased superoxide are causative factors for such an event in the vessel wall. The present study was undertaken to determine whether gene transfer of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) or manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) affects VCAM-1 levels in arteries from hypertensive rats. Isolated carotid and femoral arteries from deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats were transduced for 4 hours with adenoviral vectors encoding eNOS, MnSOD, or β-galactosidase reporter genes. Recombinant eNOS or MnSOD expression was evident morphologically and quantitatively 24 hours after gene transfer. Immunohistochemistry, ELISA, and Western blot techniques were used to determine VCAM-1 expression and levels. In addition, endogenous eNOS and MnSOD and in situ superoxide levels were analyzed by immunoblotting and fluorescence confocal microscopy, respectively. Arterial VCAM-1 expression was significantly higher in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats than in sham-operated rats; this expression was accompanied by decreased MnSOD but unaltered endogenous eNOS levels. VCAM-1 expression was significantly lower in MnSOD- and eNOS-transduced hypertensive arteries, with a concomitant reduction of superoxide level. These results suggest that gene transfer of MnSOD or eNOS suppresses arterial VCAM-1 expression in DOCA-salt hypertension by reducing the superoxide level.</jats:p>",

Thus, we examined the effects of coexistence of hypercholesterolemia and hypertension on AVV formation. In Wistar rats, hypercholesterolemia was established by high-cholesterol diet from Day −14 (HC rats), and hypertension was induced by a suprarenal aortic constriction at Day 0 (HT rats). At Day 28, we studied AVV density, adventitial area, and medial thickness in the ascending aorta of control (standard diet+sham operation), HC, HT, and HC+HT rats (n=5/group). In HC rats, although the adventitial area was modestly increased, the AVV density and medial thickness were unchanged versus controls. In addition to medial thickening, marked enlargement of the adventitial area accompanied by increased AVV density was observed in HT rats, compared with controls. HC+HT rats showed lower AVV density, despite larger adventitial area, than HT rats, whereas the medial thickness was similar in HT and HC+HT rats. Immunohistostaining revealed hypoxia-inducible factor-1α expression in the media only in HC+HT rats but not in the other 3 groups, suggesting persistent medial hypoxia in HC+HT rats. In conclusion, it is suggested that coexistence of hypercholesterolemia and hypertension impairs AVV formation, resulting in insufficient compensation for hypoxia in the thickened media.

For this purpose, we characterized the effects of inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-α (100 μg/L), interleukin-1β (20 μg/L), and interferon-γ (0.5 U/L) on ADM gene expression in rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (AVSMCs). We found that inflammatory cytokines induced a time-dependent 12-fold upregulation of ADM mRNA in AVSMCs that was paralleled by a substantial increase in inducible NO synthase mRNA expression. The stimulatory effect of cytokines on ADM gene expression was attenuated by NO deprivation induced by\n            <jats:italic>Nω</jats:italic>\n            -nitro-\n            <jats:sc>l</jats:sc>\n            -arginine methyl ester (1 mmol/L) and was in part mimicked by the NO donor\n            <jats:italic>S</jats:italic>\n            -nitroso-\n            <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>\n            -acetylpenicillamine (100 μmol/L). The cGMP analog 8-bromo-cGMP (100 μmol/L) had no effect on ADM gene expression, and inhibition of cGMP production by 1H-oxodiazolo-quinoxalin-1 (ODQ, 200 μmol/L) was not able to abrogate the increase of ADM mRNA induced by NO donation using\n            <jats:italic>S</jats:italic>\n            -nitroso-\n            <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>\n            -acetylpenicillamine (100 μmol/L). The significant induction of ADM gene expression by inflammatory cytokines and NO donation was also observed in mesangial cells, endothelial cells, and hepatocytes. These findings suggest that NO is a direct activator of ADM gene expression in a variety of cell types and that inflammatory cytokines stimulate ADM expression via both NO-dependent and -independent mechanisms. The stimulatory effect of NO appears to not be related to the classic guanylate cyclase–cGMP pathway.\n          </jats:p>",

Because chronic activation downregulated endogenous PKG I, we explored whether gene transfer of PKG I would enhance the sensitivity of cardiomyocytes to the antihypertrophic effects of NO/cGMP.

Moreover, overexpression of PKG Iβ did not enhance the proapoptotic effects of 1000 μmol/L SNAP, implying PKG-independent effects of NO on apoptosis. Endogenous PKG I mediates antihypertrophic but not proapoptotic effects of NO in a cell culture model of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Adenoviral gene transfer of PKG I selectively enhances the antihypertrophic effects of NO without increasing the susceptibility to apoptosis.\n          </jats:p>",

When GATT/WTO bargaining is law-based, consensus outcomes are Pareto-improving and roughly symmetrical. When bargaining is power-based, states bring to bear instruments of power that are extrinsic to rules, invisibly weighting the process and generating consensus outcomes that are asymmetrical and may not be Pareto-improving. Empirical analysis shows that although trade rounds have been launched through law-based bargaining, hard law is generated when a round is closed, and rounds have been closed through power-based bargaining. Agenda setting has taken place in the shadow of that power and has been dominated by the European Community and the United States. The decision making rules have been maintained because they help generate information used by powerful states in the agenda-setting process. Consensus decision making at the GATT/WTO is organized hypocrisy, allowing adherence to the instrumental reality of asymmetrical power and the sovereign equality principle upon which consensus decision making is purportedly based.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>A simple model of spike generation is described that gives rise to negative correlations in the interspike interval (ISI) sequence and leads to long-term spike train regularization. This regularization can be seen by examining the variance of thekth-order interval distribution for large k (the times between spike i and spike i Ck). The variance is much smaller than would be expected if successive ISIs were uncorrelated. Such regularizing effects have been observed in the spike trains of electrosensory afferent nerve fibers and can lead to dramatic improvement in the detectability of weak signals encoded in the spike train data (Ratnam &amp; Nelson, 2000). Here, we present a simple neural model in which negative ISI correlations and long-term spike train regularization arise from refractory effects associated with a dynamic spike threshold. Our model is derived from a more detailed model of electrosensory afferent dynamics developed recently by other investigators (Chacron, Longtin, St.-Hilaire, &amp; Maler, 2000; Chacron, Longtin, &amp; Maler, 2001). The core of this model is a dynamic spike threshold that is transiently elevated following a spike and subsequently decays until the next spike is generated. Here, we present a simplified version—the linear adaptive threshold model—that contains a single state variable and three free parameters that control the mean and coefficient of variation of the spontaneous ISI distribution and the frequency characteristics of the driven response. We show that refractory effects associated with the dynamic threshold lead to regularization of the spike train on long timescales. Furthermore, we show that this regularization enhances the detectability of weak signals encoded by the linear adaptive threshold model. Although inspired by properties of electrosensory afferent nerve fibers, such regularizing effects may play an important role in other neural systems where weak signals must be reliably detected in noisy spike trains. When modeling a neuronal system that exhibits this type of ISI correlation structure, the linear adaptive threshold model may</jats:p>",

This case provides an example of how a firm can use interorganizational information systems (IOISs) to move toward environmentally sustainable business practices. Through the use of IOISs, ASG has been able to improve its environmental performance and that of its suppliers. Further, this improved environmental performance has been a competitive advantage for ASG and enabled it to attract new business. As such, ASG's experiences illustrate how aggressive practices move environmental management beyond compliance and cost control, at which many firms have been successful, to revenue generation. The case also shows how environmentally sustainable business practices can be integrated into a firm's strategy. In addition to illustrating how ASG has used IOISs to improve environmental performance, we compare their use of environmental ISs with the expected evolution of environmental ISs presented in the Shaft and colleagues (1997) framework. Although some of ASG's experiences verify the expected progression of these types of systems, some developments are not as expected. These differences have implications for the framework.</jats:p>",

The Kano technique was developed in the 1980s to facilitate design of innovative products.

The first case—the changes in Japanese FDI to Asia in the 1970s—demonstrates that Japanese firms and the Japanese state consciously attempted to relocate highly-polluting industry in order to escape anti-pollution protest in Japan. The second case—the effort to create in Asia and the Pacific an export-oriented industrial tree plantation (ITP) sector supplying regional pulp and paper markets—shows, somewhat counterintuitively, that political contestation related to the environmental problems caused by ITPs has encouraged Japanese companies to concentrate their tree planting activity not in Southeast Asia but in Australia. </jats:p>",

However, development patterns in core regions of Europe and East Asia were surprisingly similar until almost 1800, and Europe's divergence thereafter was shaped by exceptional resource bonanzas. East Asian growth has been less-resource-intensive, and based on different social ideas. Recently, \"East Asian\" growth has spread to coastal China, but China's interior poses greater challenges; current interest in more resource-intensive, state-centered development strategies for those regions (which resemble those predicted by Gerschenkron) is thus unsurprising, but environmentally and socially risky. La plus grande partie de la littérature sur l'Asie de l'Est prend comme modèle le développement économique et social du Nord-Atlantique, insistant également sur un chemin spécifiquement \"Est-Asiatique\" qui a été suivi par la region dans le 20e siècle. Néanmoins, l'histoire du développement économique dans les regions centrales de l'Europe est semblable à celle de L'Asie de l'Est, jusqu'au début du 19e siècle. La divergence de l'Europe après 1800 se déterminait comme résultat d'un accès exceptionnel aux ressources naturelles permettant une sur-croissance économique ininterrompue. La croissance en Asie de l'Est était nettement moins dependante sur l'acces aux ressources, et fût basée sur un système d'idées sociales très différent.

The central government restricted itself to the distribution of a variety of resources to its rural estates and to the organisation of supplementary labourers. The \"farmer\" (ikkarum) managed the basic work unit, plough teams, in order to meet production goals, but his simultaneous contracts with directors of different estates both allowed for his investment (and private gain) and stimulated efficient employment of the palace's resources.

    "abstract": "<jats:sec><jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This paper examines the relevance and importance of the large number of examples which Aristotle uses in his Prior Analytics. In the first part of the paper three preliminary issues are raised: First, it investigates what counts as an example in Aristotle's syllogistic, and especially whether only examples expressed in concrete terms should be considered as examples or maybe also propositions and arguments with letters of the alphabet. The second issue concerns the kinds of examples Aristotle actually uses from everyday life as well as from various scientific and philosophical forms of discourse; among these, it seems that biological examples, rather than mathematical ones, have a predominant place. Finally, I discuss what Aristotle himself has to say about the use of examples, and in particular about the similarity between the use of an example and the use of induction. The second part of the paper focusses on the functions of Aristotle's logical examples. It is of course obvious that some of the examples in the Prior Analytics are used to illustrate, and thus to clarify, a definition, a logical rule, a type of argument. However, I think that Aristotle's logical examples have another function, which is philosophically more interesting, namely as integral parts of the procedure of proving something. To support this claim, I analyse three passages from the Prior Analytics in which examples are used either in order to prove that something is not the case, i.e. as counter-examples, or in order to prove positively that it is possible for something to be the case. At the end, I argue that for such uses of examples Aristotle uses the notion of 'ekthesis', which seems to have a wider sense than usually suggested; that is to say, it is used to refer to any proof by means of an example, and not only for the procedure which Aristotle uses to reduce imperfect to perfect syllogisms.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>",

Many hold that the speech of God and the speech of the prophet are indistinguishable, but a few, including M. Biddle, maintain that Yahweh alone is the speaker. This paper contends that the speaker of Jeremiah viii 23 (and several other passages that express sympathy for the people) is not Yahweh, but Jeremiah. It argues that the sympathetic term bat-'ammî found in these passages and similar passages in Lamentations is typical of a speaker who cries out to God in complaint. Distinguishing Jeremiah's diction and concerns from Yahweh's allows the poetry of Jeremiah ii-xx to be read as dramatic dialogue.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>",

    "abstract": "<jats:sec><jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Previous studies with the Mallorcan midwife toad (Alytes muletensis) found that gravid females show inconsistent phonotactic preferences for male calls unless they are highly motivated to mate; and, non-gravid females will occasionally show phonotaxis to male advertisement calls. These results suggest that sometimes phonotaxis may not be related to seeking a mating partner. In this article we report on experiments that give further support to a non-mating function of phonotaxis in this species. Males and metamorphs were played conspecific male and female advertisement calls. Males that were expected to be unmotivated to mate were not less likely to respond to, or less consistent in their choice of, female calls than males who were expected to be motivated to mate. Metamorphs who were not yet in breeding condition nevertheless showed positive phonotaxis. We suggest that Mallorcan midwife toads may sometimes show phonotaxis simply to seek out refuges where toads aggregate.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>",

    "abstract": "<jats:sec><jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The course on nature coincides with the re-working of Merleau-Ponty's breakthrough towards an ontology and therefore plays a primordial role. The appearance of an interrogation of nature is inscribed in the movement of thought that comes after the Phenomenology of Perception. What is at issue is to show that the ontological mode of the perceived object - not the unity of a positive sense but the unity of a style that shows through in filigree in the sensible aspects - has a universal meaning, that the description of the perceived world can give way to a philosophy of perception and therefore to a theory of truth. The analysis of linguistic expression to which the philosophy of perception leads opens out onto a definition of meaning as institution, understood as what inaugurates an open series of expressive appropriations. It is this theory of institution that turns the analysis of the perceived in the direction of a reflection on nature: the perceived is no longer the originary in its difference from the derived but the natural in its difference from the instituted. Nature is the \"non-constructed, non-instituted,\" and thereby, the source of expression: \"nature is what has a sense without this sense having been posited by thought.\" The first part of the course, which consists in a historical overview, must not be considered as a mere introduction. In fact, the problem of nature is brought out into the open by means of the history of Western metaphysics, in which Descartes is the emblematic figure. The problem consists in the duality - at once unsatisfactory and unsurpassable - between two approaches to nature: the one which accentuates its determinability and therefore its transparency to the understanding; the other which emphasizes the irreducible facticity of nature and tends therefore to valorize the view-point of the senses. To conceive nature is to constitute a concept of it that allows us to \"take possession\" of this duality, that is, to found the duality. The second part of the course attempts to develop this concept of nature by drawing upon the results of contemporary science. Thus a philosophy of nature is sketched that can be summarized in four propositions: 1) the totality is no less real than the parts; 2) there is a reality of the negative and therefore no alternative between being and nothingmess; 3) a natural event is not assigned to a unique spatio-temporal localization; and 4) there is generality only as generativity.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>",

    "abstract": "<jats:sec><jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>What is eco-phenomenology? This paper argues that eco-phenomenology, in which are folded both an ecological phenomenology and a phenomenological ecology, offers us a way of developing a middle ground between phenomenology and naturalism, between intentionality and causality. Our grasp of Nature is significantly altered by thinking through four strands of time's plexity - the invisibility of time, the celebration of finitude, the coordination of rhythms, and the interruption and breakdown of temporal horizons. It is also transformed by a meditation on the role of boundaries in constituting the varieties of thinghood. Eco-phenomenology takes up in a tentative and exploratory way the traditional phenomenological claim to be able to legislate for the sciences, or at least to think across the boundaries that seem to divide them. In this way, it opens up and develops an access to Nature and the natural, one which is independent both of the conceptuality of the natural sciences and of traditional metaphysics.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>",

Increasing the proportion of total crop residues produced from a unit area of land and used as mulch increased maize grain yield, soil organic carbon, nitrogen and available phosphorus. The extra increases obtained when more than half the crop residues were applied as mulch were relatively small, however, suggesting that 25–50% of the crop residues could be removed as feed without any detrimental effect. When any crop residues rejected by sheep were mixed with livestock urine and faeces and returned to the respective fields from where the crop residues had been removed, subsequent grain yield and soil organic carbon, nitrogen, and available phosphorus increased. The study demonstrated the possibility of managing crop residues for increased productivity in smallholder mixed crop–livestock systems.</jats:p>",

However, detecting epistatic effects is difficult primarily due to insufficient sample sizes and lack of robust statistical methods. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian method to map multiple quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with epistatic effects. The method can map QTLs in complicated mating designs derived from the cross of two inbred lines. In addition to mapping QTLs for quantitative traits, the proposed method can even map genes underlying binary traits such as disease susceptibility using the threshold model. The parameters of interest are various QTL effects, including additive, dominance and epistatic effects of QTLs, the locations of identified QTLs and even the number of QTLs. When the number of QTLs is treated as an unknown parameter, the dimension of the model becomes a variable. This requires the reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The utility of the proposed method is demonstrated through analysis of simulation data.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In a companion paper, Ulitsky &amp; Collins (2000) applied the eddy-damped quasi-normal Markovian (EDQNM) turbulence theory to the mixing of two inert passive \nscalars with different diffusivities in stationary isotropic turbulence. Their paper \nshowed that a rigorous application of the EDQNM approximation leads to a scalar \ncovariance spectrum that violates the Cauchy–Schwartz inequality over a range of \nwavenumbers. The violation results from the improper functionality of the inverse \ndiffusive time scales that arise from the Markovianization of the time evolution of \nthe triple correlations. The modified inverse time scale they proposed eliminates this \nproblem and allows meaningful predictions of the scalar covariance spectrum both \nwith and without a uniform mean gradient.</jats:p><jats:p>This study uses the modified EDQNM model to investigate the spectral dynamics of \ndifferential diffusion. Consistent with recent DNS results by Yeung (1996), we observe \nthat whereas spectral transfer is predominantly from low to high wavenumbers, \nspectral incoherence, being of molecular origin, originates at high wavenumbers \nand is transferred in the opposite direction by the advective terms. Quantitative \ncomparisons between the EDQNM model and the DNS show good agreement. In \naddition, the model is shown to give excellent estimates for the dissipation coefficient \ndefined by Yeung (1998).</jats:p><jats:p>We show that the EDQNM scalar covariance spectrum for two scalars with different \nmolecular diffusivities can be approximated by the EDQNM autocorrelation spectrum \nfor a scalar with molecular diffusivity equal to the arithmetic mean of the first two \nscalars. The result is exact for the case of an isotropic scalar and is shown to be \na very good approximation for the scalar with a uniform mean gradient. We then \nexploit this relationship to derive a simple formula for the correlation coefficient of \ntwo differentially diffusing scalars as a function of their two Schmidt numbers and the \nturbulent Reynolds number. A comparison of the formula with the EDQNM model \nshows the model predicts the correct Reynolds number scaling and qualitatively \npredicts the dependence on the Schmidt numbers.</jats:p><jats:p>To investigate the degree of local versus non-local transfer of the scalar covariance \nspectrum, we divided the energy spectrum into three ranges corresponding to the \nenergy-containing eddies, the inertial range, and the dissipation range. Then, by \nconditioning the scalar transfer on the energy contained within each of the three \nranges, we have determined that the transfer process is dominated first by local \ninteractions (local transfer) followed by non-local interactions leading to local transfer. \nNon-local interactions leading to non-local transfer are found to be significant at the \nhigher wavenumbers. This result has important implications for defining simpler \nspectral models that potentially can be applied to more complex engineering flows.</jats:p>",

Two facing walls which move parallel to each other with \nthe same velocity, but in opposite directions, drive a plane flow in the cross-section \nof the slab. A linear stability analysis shows that the two-dimensional flow becomes \nunstable to different modes, depending on the cross-sectional aspect ratio, when the \nReynolds number is increased. The critical mode is found to be stationary for all \naspect ratios. When the separation of the moving walls is larger than approximately \ntwice the height of the cavity, the basic flow forms two vortices, each close to one \nof the moving walls. The instability of this flow is of centrifugal type and similar to \nthat in the classical lid-driven cavity problem with a single moving wall. When the \nmoving walls are sufficiently close to each other (aspect ratio less than 2) the two \nvortices merge and form an elliptically strained vortex. Owing to the dipolar strain \nthis flow becomes unstable through the elliptic instability. When both moving walls \nare very close, the finite-length plane-Couette flow becomes unstable by a similar \nelliptic mechanism near both turning zones. The critical mode produces wide streaks \nreaching far into the cavity. For a small range of aspect ratios near unity the flow \nconsists of a single vortex. Here, the strain field is dominated by a four-fold symmetry. \nAs a result the instability process is analogous to the instability of a Rankine vortex \nin an quadripolar strain field, resulting from vortex stretching into the four corners \nof the cavity.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The steady response of an infinite unbroken floating ice sheet to a moving load is \nconsidered. It is assumed that the ice sheet is supported below by water of finite \nuniform depth. For a concentrated line load, earlier studies based on the linearization \nof the problem have shown that there are two ‘critical’ load speeds near which \nthe steady deflection is unbounded. These two speeds are the speed <jats:italic>c</jats:italic><jats:sub>0</jats:sub> of gravity \nwaves on shallow water and the minimum phase speed <jats:italic>c</jats:italic><jats:sub>min</jats:sub>. Since deflections cannot \nbecome infinite as the load speed approaches a critical speed, Nevel (1970) suggested \nnonlinear effects, dissipation or inhomogeneity of the ice, as possible explanations. \nThe present study is restricted to the effects of nonlinearity when the load speed is \nclose to <jats:italic>c</jats:italic><jats:sub>min</jats:sub>. A weakly nonlinear analysis, based on dynamical systems theory and \non normal forms, is performed. The difference between the critical speed <jats:italic>c</jats:italic><jats:sub>min</jats:sub> and \nthe load speed <jats:italic>U</jats:italic> is taken as the bifurcation parameter. The resulting normal form \nreduces at leading order to a forced nonlinear Schrödinger equation, which can be \nintegrated exactly. It is shown that the water depth plays a role in the effects of \nnonlinearity. For large enough water depths, ice deflections in the form of solitary \nwaves exist for all speeds up to (and including) <jats:italic>c</jats:italic><jats:sub>min</jats:sub>. For small enough water depths, \nsteady bounded deflections exist only for speeds up to <jats:italic>U</jats:italic>*, with <jats:italic>U</jats:italic>* &lt; <jats:italic>c</jats:italic><jats:sub>min</jats:sub>. The weakly \nnonlinear results are validated by comparison with numerical results based on the full \ngoverning equations. The model is validated by comparison with experimental results \nin Antarctica (deep water) and in a lake in Japan (relatively shallow water). Finally, \nnonlinear effects are compared with dissipation effects. Our main conclusion is that \nnonlinear effects play a role in the response of a floating ice plate to a load moving \nat a speed slightly smaller than <jats:italic>c</jats:italic><jats:sub>min</jats:sub>. In deep water, they are a possible explanation \nfor the persistence of bounded ice deflections for load speeds up to <jats:italic>c</jats:italic><jats:sub>min</jats:sub>. In shallow \nwater, there seems to be an apparent contradiction, since bounded ice deflections have \nbeen observed for speeds up to <jats:italic>c</jats:italic><jats:sub>min</jats:sub> while the theoretical results predict bounded ice \ndeflection only for speeds up to <jats:italic>U</jats:italic>* &lt; <jats:italic>c</jats:italic><jats:sub>min</jats:sub>.

However, in North-Central Peninsular Spanish (NCS), spirantization interacts with coda devoicing, yielding voiceless fricatives. In the majority of cases, coda /b, d, [vvplosive]/ occur in stressed syllables. This work examines whether or not stress is a factor in the likelihood of frication and devoicing of coda /b, d, [vvplosive]/ in this dialect. An acoustic study was conducted of nine native speakers from NCS. These speakers were tested on nonce words with /b, d, [vvplosive]/ in coda position in both stressed and unstressed syllables. Measurements were made of vowel and consonant duration, presence and absence of frication and voicing, and voicing duration. The results show that frication is more likely in stressed syllables than in unstressed syllables. This suggests that in stressed syllables, a higher subglottal pressure produces higher airflow across the glottis, thereby favoring frication. In turn, frication inhibits voicing due to conflicting aerodynamic requirements between the two. We conclude that stress is a factor in spirantization and that it may indirectly affect the voicing properties of /b, d, [vvplosive]/.</jats:p>",

I argue that by adhering to an instrumental view of reason, and an analogical or partially univocal theory of theistic reference, he is able to construct a concept of God which draws first and foremost on the Christian canon and in addition on logic and metaphysics.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In the Australian wet–dry tropics, temperatures are high year-round but rainfall is concentrated in a 4-mo wet season. Regular nightly surveys in the Fogg Dam Nature Reserve provided data on temporal (monthly, seasonal) variation in biological attributes of three snake species: water pythons (<jats:italic>Liasis fuscus</jats:italic>, Pythonidae), keelbacks (<jats:italic>Tropidonophis mairii</jats:italic>, Colubridae) and slatey-grey snakes (<jats:italic>Stegonotus cucullatus</jats:italic>, Colubridae). Adults of all three taxa were encountered more frequently during the dry season than the wet season, whereas juveniles were more commonly encountered in the wet season. The sex ratio among adult snakes also shifted seasonally, but in different ways in different species. These sex-ratio shifts probably reflect reproductive activity (mate-searching by males, oviposition migrations by females) and were accompanied by increased encounter rates. Feeding rates and body condition of keelbacks (a frog specialist) were highest during the wet season when frogs were most abundant. Rats migrated away from Fogg Dam during the wet season, and most pythons (rat specialists) left this area to follow their prey. The pythons that remained at Fogg Dam exhibited low feeding rates and poor body condition. Slatey-grey snakes (a generalist predator) showed less seasonal variation in feeding rates or body condition. Our data show that tropical seasonality induces strong fluctuations in many attributes of snake populations, and that patterns of response differ both among and within species.</jats:p>",

By choosing a suitable effective height of the residual ionosphere, the resulting path delay for positive elevations is then computed from a thin layer approximation. The scale factor can be predicted from the assumption of a Chapman profile for the altitude variation of the electron density or adjusted as a free parameter in the processing of an extended set of single frequency measurements. The suitability of the proposed model is assessed by comparison with flight data from the Champ satellite that orbits the Earth at an altitude of 450 km. For the given test case, a 90% correction of the ionospheric error is achieved in a reduced dynamic orbit determination based on single frequency C/A-code measurements.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Breeding of the threatened long‐tailed bat <jats:italic>Chalinolobus tuberculatus</jats:italic> was studied over seven summers, 1993–2000, in temperate rainforest, Fiordland, New Zealand. Reproductive history of 789 marked bats from three social groups was investigated. Seventy per cent of births occurred over a 10‐day period in mid‐December. Young began flying at 5–6 weeks and nipples of reproductive females were regressing 2 weeks later. Sex ratio at birth was equal. Lactation coincided with highest annual air temperatures and peak abundance of flying invertebrates. Date of first birth varied by 4 days annually, but date of first flight varied by 17 days. Males had distended cauda epididymides at 1 year old (mean±SE = 1.63±0.16 years) and epididymal distension peaked in early autumn. Females first gave birth at 2–3 years of age (2.33±0.08 years). The short, highly synchronous breeding season, birth of single young, early mating in autumn, and late age of female sexual maturity compared to similar‐sized vespertilionids, may be related to low food availability and unpredictable cold‐temperate weather conditions. Annual productivity did not differ among groups but probability of survival of juveniles varied from 0.26 to 0.88 and was inversely proportional to size of natal group. Variability in breeding parameters was unrelated to climate or body condition of bats. The group with highest survival rates contained reproductive females and juveniles with significantly higher body condition. Differences in roost site or food quality within the home range of each group, varying genetic quality of members of the groups, or density‐dependent mechanisms, may explain differential survival, but these hypotheses require investigation. A population crash and poor productivity in 1996 coincided with an irruption in the numbers of stoats <jats:italic>Mustela erminea</jats:italic> implying that predation by introduced animals can cause periodic population crashes.

No pyrazine could be detected in cloacal extracts. The experiment shows that an external odour can affect the internal reproductive system of the chicken.

The article examines three stages of reform and abolition stretching over the mid-Victorian period: a first stage that centred upon imposing a system of hiring based upon written characters; a second stage that focussed upon imposing segregated hiring for male and female servants, and a final abolitionist stage. The campaign's tactics and the various measures deployed against hiring fairs during each stage are detailed and their level of success evaluated and explained. The broader motivations of the campaign and the manner in which they signified deeper Church anxieties about the nature of the rural social order are also discussed in a concluding evaluation of the campaign's impact.</jats:p>",

Threats to the population include illegal hunting, habitat loss through agricultural intensification (irrigation, use of pesticides) and infrastructural changes (construction of a motorway and a powerplant), disturbance, and accidents at powerlines and antennas. Several conservation measures are suggested: cease hunting; maximize the attention given to display sites; encourage villagers to carry out “Great Bustard-friendly” land use and adapt animal stocks to the carrying capacity of their regions; clarify the situation of genetic exchange between Spanish and Moroccan populations; study movements between the Moroccan sites; monitor the size and trends of the most important subpopulations; and conduct education campaigns in schools and increase public awareness among adults.</jats:p>",

On the contrary, in addition to evident cytoplasmic disintegration, a clearly different labelling pattern and a low labelling intensity were observed in the nuclei of the segregated cells in the subzonal space and in those free in the blastocoele cavity. A typical nuclear morphological feature of these blastomeres was chromatin marginalisation, similar to that observed in embryos treated with actinomycin D for transcription inhibition.

Cattle oocytes exposed to buffalo sperm showed 86.3% cleavage, while 25.9% of these attained the blastocyst stage. The speed of development of both types of hybrids was intermediate between that of cattle and buffalo embryos, with hatching occurring on day 7.5 in hybrid embryos, day 8-9 in cattle and day 7 in buffalo. The proportions of cells contributing to the trophectoderm and the inner cell mass were closer to those of the maternal species in both types of hybrid embryos.

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Météo‐France is preparing the implementation of a revised graphical summary of the synoptic situation. This graphical product has been developed since 1993 as, as far as possible, an extension of the existing framework published by WMO. Graphics remain the best way to convey rapidly a lot of information. However, the existing graphical language for meteorology has seldom changed over the years, while our dynamical understanding has improved. Its current use is in fact poorer than the one allowed by the WMO reference definition. In an attempt to overcome these drawbacks, a richer graphical language is proposed. Its goal is to show and, often, to explain areas of synoptic weather activity in the initial spirit of the Norwegian method, since it has been so successful in shaping modern operational meteorology. However, it takes into account the present understanding of cyclogenesis and large‐scale dynamics: the actual and potential baroclinic interactions replace the polar front concept. Dynamical meteorology also provides rather precise guidance for structuring and preparing the summary. The proposed code is described and explained. Examples are shown, with most cases taken from the recent FASTEX (Fronts and Atlantic Storm‐Track Experiment) project. Copyright © 2002 Royal Meteorological Society</jats:p>",

The rain area was generated in the exit region of an upper‐level jet characterised by laminated velocity perturbations. Some of the perturbations were attributable to inertia‐gravity wave activity. The rain area itself is shown to have been composed of a well‐organised set of mesoscale rainbands each being due to a mixture of upright and slantwise convection. The existence of the multiple rainbands may have been related to the multi‐layered atmospheric structure upwind. Each of the rainbands had cold‐frontal and warm‐frontal portions, so as to form a series of mini warm sectors stacked along the axis of the comma cloud at roughly 70 km intervals. The multiple rainbands were accompanied by multiple fingers of overrunning low‐θw air from part of a dry intrusion originating from just below a major tropopause fold. The fold contained an intense potential‐vorticity maximum which appeared to be the focus of the overall system. The operational mesoscale version of the Met. Office's Unified Model, with its 12 km grid, is shown to have resolved many but not all of the key features of the rainbands. It is suggested that further improvements in very‐short‐range forecasting of important local detail could be achieved by further increasing its resolution and assimilating more mesoscale observational data.

A new approach is introduced to explain the errors relative to the official weather variables. Many weather periods have been analysed, but here results are presented for a snow period with slight and very slight precipitation. The best predictive variables were the dew point temperature, wind direction, relative humidity and visibility.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>For a long time, the discussion about the impact of economic globalisation on the full employment/generous welfare state policies pursued by social democratic governments was characterised by doom and gloom. Glib neo-liberal arguments about the impossibility of maintaining social democratic policies, that were presumably hindering competitiveness through excessive wages and taxes in the new international environment were difficult to counter, because social democrats could not resort to an equally elaborate and internally consistent economic doctrine that could substitute for evidence, and the evidence was not yet in to counter these arguments on empirical grounds. Recently, careful and comprehensive comparative studies have provided evidence that, despite undeniable problems posed by economic internationalisation, social democratic welfare states and employment regimes have proven to be highly resilient (Scharpf and Schmidt, 2000; Huber and Stephens, 2001). Indeed, some kinds of traditional social democratic policy, such as an emphasis on labour mobilisation through active labour market policy and social services that make it possible to combine labour force participation with raising children, and an emphasis on human capital formation have facilitated adaptation to the new economic conditions. Moreover, newly available data on skill distribution (OECD/HRDC, 2000) and income distribution (LIS) suggest that the egalitarian thrust characteristic of social democratic policy has made an important contribution to raising literacy skills at the bottom, which in turn facilitates the integration of the entire labour force into productive activities that are competitive in high-quality markets.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Congenital deafness occurs in approximately 1 in 1000 live births. In developed countries about 60% of hearing loss is genetic. However, in Brazil most cases of hearing loss are due to environmental factors, such as congenital infections (mainly rubella), perinatal anoxia, kernicterus and meningitis. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the GJB2 gene is a major gene underlying congenital sensorial deafness. Mutations in this gene cause 10–20% of all genetic sensory hearing loss. One specific mutation, 35delG, accounts for the majority of mutant alleles. The extent of the hearing impairment varies from mild/moderate to profound, even within the patients homozygous for the common 35delG mutation. There may also be progression with age. Mutation analysis in the GJB2 gene was performed on 36 families (group A) presenting with at least one individual with non‐syndromic deafness (NSD). An unselected series of 26 deaf individuals referred by other services where the environmental factors were not completely excluded was also part of the study (group B).</jats:p><jats:p>Mutations in the GJB2 gene were found in 22% (eight patients) of the families tested in group A, and 11.5% (three patients) of individuals within group B. This finding should facilitate diagnosis of congenital deafness and allow early treatment of the affected subjects.</jats:p>",

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), as well as cerebellar ataxia and vertical antidirectional nystagmus, were detected. The subject's parents were first cousins, and two of his three male cousins, whose parents were also first cousins, had RP without ataxia or nystagmus.

The genetic results were negative for SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA7 and dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy.

Our aim was to determine, for the first time in schistosomiasis, Tpo serum concentrations in patients with chronic forms of the disease.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Method: </jats:bold> Twenty‐four patients with the pure form of schistosomiasis were studied; 13 had the hepatosplenic form (HE, with portal hypertension) and 11 had the hepatointestinal form (HI, without portal hypertension). Patients were HBsAg, anti‐HBc and anti‐HCV negative, and reported alcohol ingestion below 160 g/week.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results: </jats:bold> The Tpo serum concentration, determined in 10 healthy volunteers, varied from undetectable (&lt; 15 pg/mL) to 489 pg/mL (median 208 pg/mL). The HE and HI groups differed (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.004) in regard to the prothrombin index, thrombocytemia and γ‐glutamyltransferase but not in regard to Tpo (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.622). No significant correlation was found between Tpo and the other parameters (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &gt; 0.05).</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> The results suggest that Tpo serum concentration does not mirror and/or has no significant participation in the mechanisms responsible for the thrombocytopenia observed in schistosomiasis patients with splenomegaly and portal hypertension.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Viral dynamics in chronic hepatitis B patients during lamivudine therapy",
    "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Abstract: </jats:bold><jats:bold> Rationale and aim:</jats:bold> Recently, we described a first‐order decay model for the description of a decrease in viral load during treatment with lamivudine for a chronic hepatitis B virus infection (HBV). However, more frequent sampling of viral load during the first month of treatment shows a bi‐phasic viral decline. We therefore compared several mathematical models which are currently in use to describe the dynamics of various viruses and treatments.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold> HBV DNA positive chronic hepatitis B patients were treated with lamivudine 150–600 mg daily for four weeks. During the first two days, blood samples were drawn every 6 h, then daily during the first week and weekly during the following three weeks. HBV DNA was measured with the Digene Hybrid Capture II HBV DNA test and the sensitive Roche PCR assay, both calibrated on the Eurohep standard.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Our HBV DNA data are most accurately described if we use the bi‐phasic model previously described by Neumann et al. while introducing all consecutive data of all patients simultaneously (mixed effects model). This results in an effectiveness of blocking of viral replication of 93%, a half‐life of free virus of 17 h and a half‐life of infected hepatocytes of 7 day in patients treated with 150 mg of lamivudine.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> HBV dynamics during treatment with lamivudine can be explained by blocking of virion production with or without blocking of <jats:italic>de novo</jats:italic> infection. The bi‐phasic model as described by Neumann et al. in combination with frequent blood sampling provides the most accurate fit and can be used to compare new nucleoside analogue profiles to lamivudine therapy.</jats:p>",

These events are followed by myocardial cell alterations resulting eventually in cell necrosis. An enhanced formation of reactive oxygen species is widely accepted as a stimulus for tissue destruction and cardiac failure.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>In this study, we have investigated the cardioprotective effects of M40403 in myocardial ischaemia‐reperfusion injury. M40403 is a low molecular weight, synthetic manganese containing superoxide dismutase mimetic (SODm) that selectively removes superoxide anion. Ischaemia was induced in rat hearts <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic> by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery. Thirty minutes after the induction of ischaemia, the ligature was removed and reperfusion allowed to occur for at least 60 min. M40403 (0.1–1 mg kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) was given intravenously 15 min before ischaemia.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>The results obtained in this study showed that M40403 significantly reduced the extent of myocardial damage, mast cell degranulation and the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias. Furthermore, M40403 significantly attenuated, in a dose‐dependent manner, neutrophil infiltration in the myocardium as well as the associated induction of lipid peroxidation. Calcium overload seen post‐reperfusion of the ischaemic myocardium was also reduced by M40403.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Immunohistochemical analysis for nitrotyrosine revealed a positive staining in cardiac tissue taken after reperfusion: this was attenuated by M40403. Moreover reperfused cardiac tissue sections showed positive staining for P‐selectin and for anti‐intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM‐1) in the vascular endothelial cells. M40403 treatment markedly reduced the intensity and degree of P‐selectin and ICAM‐1 in these tissues. No staining for nitrotyrosine, P‐selectin or ICAM‐1 was found in cardiac tissue taken at the end of the ischaemic period.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Overall, M40403 treatment reduced the morphological signs of myocardial cell injury and significantly improved survival.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Taken together, these results clearly indicate that M40403 treatment exerts a protective effect against ischaemia‐reperfusion‐induced myocardial injury, supporting a key role for superoxide anion in reperfusion injuries. This suggests that synthetic enzymes of SOD such as M40403, offer a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of ischaemic heart disease where superoxide anion plays a dominant role.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n</jats:list>\n</jats:p><jats:p><jats:italic>British Journal of Pharmacology</jats:italic> (2002) <jats:bold>136</jats:bold>, 905–917. doi:<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"doi\" xlink:href=\"10.1038/sj.bjp.0704774\">10.1038/sj.bjp.0704774</jats:ext-link></jats:p>",

Interleukin 6 (IL-6) with dexamethasone (DEX) decreases transcription of rGSTA2 in rat hepatocytes. The promoter region that mediates suppression of rGSTA2 was localized to 150bp. These 150bp were divided and used for electrophoretic mobility-shift assays. Induction of a protein that specifically bound to an oligonucleotide from this region required new protein synthesis and IL-6 with DEX in the culture media. The protein bound to part of the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1) site but was different from and did not displace HNF1. A core sequence, TGATT, was required for binding. The protein also bound to an HNF1 site in the albumin promoter. We hypothesize that IL-6 along with DEX induced a novel protein that decreased transcription of rGSTA2 and possibly albumin by interfering with the transactivating function of HNF1. The protein may be an important negative regulator of transcription during the acute-phase response.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Total direct chemical synthesis and biological activities of human group IIA secretory phospholipase A2",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Human group IIA secretory phospholipase A2 (hGIIA sPLA2) is reported to be involved in inflammation, since its expression level is enhanced under various inflammatory conditions. In this work, we report the total chemical synthesis of this enzyme (124 amino acids) by solid-phase method. The identity of the protein, in denatured or folded (7 disulphide bonds) forms, was confirmed by electrospray MS. Synthetic sPLA2 possesses the same circular dichroism spectrum, enzymic activity in hydrolysing different phospholipid substrates, and inhibitory effect in thrombin formation from prothrombinase complex as the recombinant sPLA2. Furthermore, LY311727, a reported specific hGIIA sPLA2 inhibitor, is able to inhibit the synthetic and the recombinant enzymes with the same efficiency. This study demonstrates that chemically continuous solid phase synthesis is an alternative and less time-consuming approach to producing small, structurally folded and fully active proteins of up to 124 amino acids, such as hGIIA sPLA2. Moreover, this technique provides more flexibility in analogue synthesis to elucidate their physiological functions and pathological effects.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The (murine) type I interferon (IFN) receptor, muIfnar-2, is expressed ubiquitously, and exists as both transmembrane and soluble forms. In the present study we show that the gene encoding muIfnar-2 spans approx. 33kb on mouse chromosome 16, and consists of nine exons and eight introns. The three mRNA splice variants resulting in one transmembrane (muIfnar-2c) and two soluble (muIfnar-2a/2a′) mRNA isoforms are generated by alternative RNA processing of the muIfnar-2 gene. Treatment of a range of murine cell lines with a combination of type I and II IFN showed that the muIfnar-2a and −2c mRNA isoforms were up-regulated independently of each other in L929 fibroblasts and hepa-1c1c7 hepatoma cells, but not in M1 myeloid leukaemia cells. Analysis of the 5′ flanking region of muIfnar-2 using promoter—luciferase reporter constructs defined three regulatory regions: a region proximal to exon 1, conferring high basal expression, a distal region conferring inducible expression, and a negative regulatory region between the two. These data represent the first promoter analysis of a type I IFN receptor and, taken together with our previous data demonstrating high expression levels and dual biological functions for muIfnar-2a protein, suggests that the regulation of muIfnar-2 isoform expression may be an important way of modulating type I IFN responses.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>DT40 cells have approx. 10-fold higher Mg2+-dependent neutral sphingomyelinase (NSM) activity in comparison with other B-cell lines and contain very low acidic sphingomyelinase activity. Purification of this activity from DT40 cell membranes suggested the presence of one major NSM isoform. Although complete purification of this isoform could not be achieved, partially purified fractions were examined further with regard to the known characteristics of previously partially purified NSMs and the two cloned enzymes exhibiting in vitro NSM activity (NSM1 and NSM2). For a direct comparative study, highly purified brain preparations, purified NSM1 protein and Bacillus cereus enzyme were used. Analysis of the enzymic properties of the partially purified DT40 NSM, such as cation dependence, substrate specificity, redox regulation and stimulation by phosphatidylserine, together with the localization of this enzyme to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), suggested that this NSM from DT40 cells corresponds to NSM1. Further studies aimed to correlate presence of the high levels of this NSM1-like activity in DT40 cells with the ability of these cells to accumulate ceramide and undergo apoptosis. When DT40 cells were stimulated to apoptose by a variety of agents, including the ER stress, an increase in endogenous ceramide levels was observed. However, these responses were not enhanced compared with another B-cell line (Nalm-6), characterized by low sphingomyelinase activity. In addition, DT40 cells were not more susceptible to ceramide accumulation and apoptosis when exposed to the ER stress compared with other apoptotic agents. Inhibition of de novo synthesis of ceramide partially inhibited its accumulation, indicating that the ceramide production in DT40 cells could be complex and, under some conditions, could involve both sphingomyelin hydrolysis and ceramide synthesis.</jats:p>",

We found the following: (1) externally added d-lactate causes oxygen uptake by mitochondria [P/O ratio (the ratio of mol of ATP synthesized to mol of oxygen atoms reduced to water during oxidative phosphorylation) = 2] and membrane potential (Δψ) generation in processes that are rotenone-insensitive, but inhibited by antimycin A and cyanide, and proton release from coupled mitochondria inhibited by α-cyanocinnamate, but not by phenylsuccinate; (2) the activity of the putative flavoprotein (d-lactate dehydrogenase) was detected in inside-out submitochondrial particles, but not in mitochondria and mitoplasts, as it is localized in the matrix phase of the mitochondrial inner membrane; (3) three novel separate translocators exist to mediate d-lactate traffic across the mitochondrial inner membrane: the d-lactate/H+ symporter, which was investigated by measuring fluorimetrically the rate of endogenous flavin reduction, the d-lactate/oxoacid antiporter (which mediates both the d-lactate/pyruvate and d-lactate/oxaloacetate exchanges) and d-lactate/malate antiporter studied by monitoring photometrically the appearance of the d-lactate counteranions outside mitochondria. The d-lactate translocators, in the light of their different inhibition profiles separate from the monocarboxylate carrier, were found to differ from each other in the Vmax values and in the inhibition and pH profiles and were shown to regulate mitochondrial d-lactate metabolism in vitro. The d-lactate translocators and the d-lactate dehydrogenase could account for the removal of the toxic methylglyoxal from cytosol, as well as for d-lactate-dependent gluconeogenesis.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Homo- and hetero-oligomerization of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) were examined in HEK-293 cells using two variants of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET). BRET2 (a variant of BRET) offers greatly improved separation of the emission spectra of the donor and acceptor moieties compared with traditional BRET. Previously recorded homo-oligomerization of the human δ-opioid receptor was confirmed using BRET2. Homo-oligomerization of the κ-opioid receptor was observed using both BRET techniques. Both homo- and hetero-oligomers, containing both δ- and κ-opioid receptors, were unaffected by the presence of receptor ligands. BRET detection of opioid receptor homo- and hetero-oligomers required expression of 50000–100000 copies of the receptor energy acceptor construct per cell. The effectiveness of δ—κ-opioid receptor hetero-oligomer formation was as great as for homomeric interactions. The capacity of the two opioid receptors to form oligomeric complexes with the β2-adrenoceptor was also assessed. Although such interactions were detected, at least 250000 copies per cell of the energy acceptor were required. Requirement for high levels of receptor expression was equally pronounced in attempts to measure hetero-oligomer formation between the κ-opioid receptor and the thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor-1. These studies indicate that constitutively formed homo- and hetero-oligomers of opioid receptor subtypes can be detected in living cells containing less than 100000 copies of the receptors. However, although hetero-oligomeric interactions between certain less closely related GPCRs can be detected, they appear to be of lower affinity than homo- or hetero-oligomers containing closely related sequences. Interactions recorded between certain GPCR family members in heterologous expression systems are likely to be artefacts of extreme levels of overexpression.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Embryonic extracts derived from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans remove uracil from DNA by the sequential action of uracil-DNA glycosylase and AP (apurinic/apyrimidinic) endonuclease",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>DNA bases continuously undergo modifications in response to endogenous reactions such as oxidation, alkylation or deamination. The modified bases are primarily removed by DNA glycosylases, which cleave the N-glycosylic bond linking the base to the sugar, to generate an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site, and this latter lesion is highly mutagenic. Previously, no study has demonstrated the processing of these lesions in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Herein, we report the existence of uracil-DNA glycosylase and AP endonuclease activities in extracts derived from embryos of C. elegans. These enzyme activities were monitored using a defined 5′-end 32P-labelled 42-bp synthetic oligonucleotide substrate bearing a single uracil residue opposite guanine at position 21. The embryonic extract rapidly cleaved the substrate in a time-dependent manner to produce a 20-mer product. The extract did not excise adenine or thymine opposite guanine, although uracil opposite either adenine or thymine was processed. Addition of the highly specific inhibitor of uracil-DNA glycosylase produced by Bacillus subtilis to the extract prevented the formation of the 20-mer product, indicating that removal of uracil is catalysed by uracil-DNA glycosylase. The data suggest that the 20-mer product was generated by a sequential reaction, i.e., removal of the uracil base followed by 5′-cleavage of the AP site. Further analysis revealed that product formation was dependent upon the presence of Mg2+, suggesting that cleavage of the AP site, following uracil excision, is carried out by a Mg2+-dependent AP endonuclease. It would appear that these activities correspond to the first two steps of a putative base-excision-repair pathway in C. elegans.</jats:p>",

On reduction, the haem co-ordinations change to His/Met and His/vacant respectively. If the latter form of the enzyme is reoxidized, a conformer is generated in which the ferric c haem is His/Met co-ordinated; this can revert to the ‘as isolated’ state of the enzyme over approx. 20min at room temperature. However, addition of nitrite to the enzyme after a cycle of reduction and reoxidation produces a kinetically stable, all-ferric complex with nitrite bound to the d1 haem and His/Met co-ordination of the c haem. This complex is catalytically active with the physiological electron donor protein pseudoazurin. The effective dissociation constant for nitrite is 2mM. Evidence is presented that d1 haem is optimized to bind nitrite, as opposed to other anions that are commonly good ligands to ferric haem. The all-ferric nitrite bound state of the enzyme could not be generated stoichiometrically by mixing nitrite with the ‘as isolated’ conformer of cytochrome cd1 without redox cycling.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Background. The importance of evidence‐based practice has stimulated interest in the methodology of clinical trials. Various weaknesses of evaluation research in the alcohol field have been indicated previously. This study set out to develop a comprehensive system for the assessment of the methodological quality of outcome research for treatment of alcohol misuse and to apply the system to well‐known trials in the area. Methodology. A sample of the most highly cited controlled trials of interventions for alcohol misuse was selected using the Science Citation Index. Thirty methodological criteria were formulated and a scoring system devised. Two raters applied this system to the sample of trials. Reliability testing was performed and used to refine the criteria. Results. Inter‐rater reliability of the overall quality score was initially 0.85 and 0.92 after review and re‐rating. Internal consistency was also high (0.87). Quality score correlated with year of publication. Certain areas of methodology were poorly addressed in the sample, including specification of main outcomes, documentation of recruitment and selection procedures, testing of blinding, analysis of withdrawals and reporting of results. Discussion. The methodology of this sample of trials was frequently deficient in ways which might bias results or compromise generalizability. It is recommended that the system of quality assessment described here is used to evaluate existing research and to inform the design of future studies.</jats:p>",

This study investigated whether child sexual abuse (CSA) was associated with earlier substance use and greater severity of substance dependence and what aspects of CSA might predict substance abuse. Design. The study compared (a) drug and alcohol treatment clients with and without a history of CSA and (b) CSA survivors outside drug and alcohol treatment who did or did not have current substance abuse. Settings. Semi‐structured interviews took place at participants' homes, treatment agencies or the research centre. Participants. Volunteer participants included 100 women recruited from drug and alcohol treatment programmes and 80 CSA survivors recruited through CSA counselling services and media advertising. Measurements. The results focus on data from the Opiate Treatment Index, Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire, Substance Dependence Scale, Self‐Esteem Inventory and self‐reported histories of CSA. Findings. There were no differences between CSA survivors and other drug and alcohol treatment clients in their severity of dependence. Women with a history of CSA more frequently identified stimulants as their main problem drug and reported an earlier age of first intoxication and earlier use of inhalants. Among CSA survivors outside drug and alcohol treatment, women with current substance abuse had typically been abused during adolescence by someone outside the family, whereas those without current substance abuse were typically abused by family members before adolescence. Conclusions. The results suggest that adolescence is a crucial time for the influence of CSA experiences on substance abuse.</jats:p>",

Fat intake increased from 52 g/day in 1984 to 95 g/day in 1995. Only biotin and vitamin D fell below 67% of the recommended dietary allowances (RDA) for 4‐ to 6‐year‐olds, but mean intakes concealed the high percentage of children that had intakes below the RDA in 1984 and 1995. Urban black 5‐year‐old South African children consumed a low‐fat (30% of total energy), high‐carbohydrate (61% of total energy) diet in 1984, but a typical westernised diet by 1995 (fat 41% and carbohydrate 52% of total energy). With these changes, current reliable nutrition information is needed to assess the existing and future health needs of all South Africans.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Transforming growth factor‐β is a potent regulator of numerous processes in wound healing. These biological activities require the interaction of the growth factor with two classes of cell surface receptors, namely the type I and type II receptors. To understand the role of transforming growth factor‐β in burn wound healing, we undertook a study to localize this growth factor and its cell surface receptors within dermal burn wounds. Partial‐thickness burn injuries were made on the backs of Wistar rats. At 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, and 20 days after burning, samples of wounded and control skin were removed for the isolation of total RNA and immunohistochemistry. Thermal injury induced the expression of mRNA for transforming growth factor‐β and both type I and type II receptors. The expression of transforming growth factor‐β peaked 5 to 7 days after injury, then gradually declined. Of note, the expression of the transforming growth factor‐β receptors returned to normal before the expression of the growth factor. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that transforming growth factor‐β protein levels paralleled mRNA expression, and the protein was primarily localized to the migrating epidermal cells and dermal fibroblasts. The differences between the expression of transforming growth factor‐β and its receptors in the later stages of healing thermal injuries suggests the presence of a well‐controlled mechanism to limit the effect of the growth factor on repair cells.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Cultured epidermal keratinocytes provide an abundant supply of biologic material for wound treatment. Because restoration of barrier function is a definitive criterion for efficacy of wound closure and depends on the lipids present in the epidermis, we analyzed lipid composition of the epidermis in cultured skin substitutes in vitro and after grafting to athymic mice. The cultured skin substitutes were prepared from human keratinocytes and fibroblasts attached to collagen‐glycosaminoglycan substrates. After 14 days of incubation, cultured skin substitutes were grafted orthotopically onto full‐thickness wounds in athymic mice. Samples for lipid analysis were collected after 14 and 34 days of in vitro incubation, and 3 weeks and 4 months after grafting. Both in vitro samples show disproportions in epidermal lipid profile as compared with the native human epidermis, i.e., a low amount of phospholipids (indicating imbalance in proliferation and differentiation); a large excess of triglycerides (storage lipids); and low levels of free fatty acids, glucosphingolipids, cholesterol sulfate, and ceramides—suggesting abnormal composition of stratum corneum barrier lipids. Fatty acid analysis of cultured skin substitutes in vitro revealed insufficient uptake of linoleic acid, which resulted in increased synthesis of and substitution with monounsaturated fatty acids, mainly oleic acid. These abnormalities were partially corrected by 3 weeks after grafting; and 4 months after grafting, all epidermal lipids, with some minor exceptions, were synthesized in proportions very similar to human epidermis. Results of this study show that grafting of cultured skin substitutes to a physiologic host permits the recovery of lipid in proportion to that required for barrier formation in normal human epidermis.</jats:p>",

Using a rabbit model, we applied a bovine type I collagen matrix sponge as a dermal substitute and human epidermal growth factor to full‐thickness excisional wounds. Wound contraction was assessed 14 and 28 days after wounding. It was found that both collagen matrix and epidermal growth factor significantly inhibited wound contraction (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.001) in all wounds treated with collagen matrix alone or treated with 0.1 and 1 µg of epidermal growth factor 28 days after wounding. Interestingly, the combination of collagen matrix with epidermal growth factor strongly inhibited wound contraction over matrix alone (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.01 on day 28). Histological analyses showed a regular horizontal arrangement of collagen fibers in the dermis under wounds treated with these substances but not under untreated wounds. Furthermore, using a fibroblast‐populated collagen gel, the direct inhibitory effect of epidermal growth factor on gel contraction by fibroblasts was also observed. Collagen gels without stimulation contracted to 29.5 ± 0.6% of their original size, as determined 6 days after culturing. At 3 days or more, epidermal growth factor inhibited collagen gel contraction by fibroblasts (after 6 days: 34.2 ± 1.8%, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &gt; 0.05; 36.5 ± 2.8%, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05; and 39.8 ± 2.1%, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.001 at 1, 10, and 100 ng/ml of epidermal growth factor, respectively).

The substrate consisted of a synthetic biodegradable matrix called Polyactive, which is an elastomeric poly (ether)/poly (ester) block copolymer. This matrix was manufactured either as a porous substrate, with gradually changing pore size (BISKIN‐M), or as a bilayer consisting of a porous underlayer with a fully dense surface layer (BISKIN). Cell‐free matrices and matrices seeded with autologous or allogeneic porcine fibroblasts were applied to full‐thickness skin wounds in Yucatan miniature pigs. Biopsies were taken at different time intervals up to 24‐months post‐transplantation. Although all BISKIN substrates showed little or no adherence to the wound bed, the adherence of the BISKIN‐M substrates to the underlying wound was achieved within minutes after application. Therefore, only BISKIN‐M Polyactive substrates were further evaluated. Wound contraction was inhibited by both cell‐free and fibroblast‐populated substrates. All substrates showed extensive neovascular and fibrous tissue ingrowth within 2‐weeks post‐transplantation. Furthermore, during this time period, matrix degradation was observed, starting with the fragmentation of the polymers into particles, which were phagocytized by macrophages. These processes occurred actively up to 3 months and ceased thereafter. Cell‐free substrates degraded faster, and also, the collagen deposition was lower as compared with cell‐seeded substrates. The tissue surrounding the remnants of the Polyactive substrates after 24‐months post‐transplantation consisted of a mature connective tissue. The newly formed collagen had the same distribution pattern as observed in normal native dermis. We conclude therefore that treatment of full‐thickness skin defects with fibroblast‐populated BISKIN‐M Polyactive substrates leads to satisfactory dermal regeneration.</jats:p>",

The best reduction of bacterial load was achieved after 3 hours at 20°C. In further experiments, conducted according to the former specifications, filtration of whole blood from eight and six donors with an inoculum of 100 and 500 to 1000 CFUs per mL, respectively, resulted in a total inhibition of bacterial growth up to 42 days after infection. After fractionation of blood components, in contrast to plasma and RBCs, filtration was shown to reduce dramatically the bacterial growth in buffy coats, demonstrating that the antibacterial effect of filtration was supported by the removal of infected WBCs from blood samples.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:bold>CONCLUSION</jats:bold>: These results provide support for the systematic use of blood filtration in the preparation of blood components to prevent <jats:italic>Y. enterocolitica</jats:italic> infection of patients receiving transfusions.</jats:p>",

The QOL scores, Perceived Health Index, Karnofsky score, CD4+ cell count, HIV viral load, and site were analyzed for relationships with the Hb level and the number of units transfused.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:bold>RESULTS</jats:bold>: The transfusion trigger was lower in patients with higher levels of Karnofsky score, Perceived Health Index, CD4+ cell count, and a number of QOL scales. Both the Hb trigger and the number of units transfused had a significant site variation. Males were transfused at a significantly lower Hb level than females. In multivariate analysis, the CD4+ cell count remained significant, but the Karnofsky score or the Perceived Health Index did not. The number of RBC units transfused was associated with the Hb level, CD4+ cell counts, and Karnofsky scores in unadjusted analysis but with only Hb in adjusted analysis.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:bold>CONCLUSIONS</jats:bold>: In this group of HIV+ patients, lower CD4+ cell counts prompted transfusion at higher Hb levels. However, after controlling for the Hb level, the number of units transfused was associated with only the Hb level. The HIV stage appears to influence the decision to transfuse at a particular Hb level but not to influence the number of RBC units transfused. The functional status does not appear to influence the decision to transfuse.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Summary:</jats:bold><jats:bold>  Purpose: </jats:bold> To evaluate the efficacy of the educational program MOSES (Modular Service Package Epilepsy). It was developed to improve patients' knowledge and understanding about their epilepsy, its treatment, and psychosocial consequences. The program intends to improve patients' coping with the disease, to strengthen self‐esteem, and to support patients to become experts in managing their epilepsy.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold> A controlled, randomized study design was used to examine the efficacy of MOSES. Patients from 22 epilepsy centers in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland were randomly allocated to either MOSES group (treatment group) or waiting‐list group (control group). The 242 patients were aged from 16 to 80 years. The MOSES group (n = 113) completed the questionnaires immediately before the educational course (T1) and 6 months later (T2), and the control group (n = 129), 6 months before (T1) and immediately before (T2) the course. The questionnaires included generic instruments (SF‐36, Rosenberg self‐esteem Scale, von Zerssen Depression Scale), and epilepsy‐specific scales (Restrictions in Daily Life, Epilepsy‐Related Fears, Coping with Epilepsy and Adaptation). Depression was used as a moderator variable. Seizure frequency and satisfaction with therapy also were assessed. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) with repeated measurements and univariate analyses of variance were performed.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The MANOVA showed that participants of the educational program improved significantly. Univariate analyses revealed improvements in knowledge (p &lt; 0.001) and coping with epilepsy (p = 0.004), whereas important effects of MOSES on other epilepsy‐specific measures and on generic questionnaires (SF‐36, self‐esteem) were not found. Participants of the MOSES program also improved in seizure outcome (p = 0.041) and became more satisfied with the therapy [better tolerability of antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy, fewer side effects; p = 0.014]. In addition, participants expressed being highly satisfied with the program.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> The study clearly indicates the need for patient education. Even patients with a long history of epilepsy and with additional handicaps or diseases benefitted from the MOSES program.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The combined effect of pressure and molecular vacancies on the atomic structure and electronic properties of solid nitromethane, a prototypical energetic material, is studied at zero temperature. The self-consistent charge density-functional tight-binding method is applied in order to investigate changes induced in the band gap of this system by uniform and uniaxial strain of up to 70%, corresponding to static pressure in the range of up to 200 GPa. The effects of molecular vacancies with densities ranging from 3% to 25% have also been considered. A surprising finding is that uniaxial compression of about 25–40 GPa along the b lattice vector causes the C–H bond to be highly stretched and leads to proton dissociation. This event also occurs under isotropic compression but at much higher pressure, being indicative of a detonation chemistry which is preferential to the pressure anisotropy. We also find that the band gap, although evidently dependent on the applied strain, crystal anisotropy and vacancy density, is not reduced considerably for electronic excitations to be dominant, in agreement with other recent first-principles studies.</jats:p>",

In addition, we demonstrate examples of characterization of molecular alignment in highly oriented samples by monitoring the angular dependence of the polarized Raman signal. Finally, we show the use of temperature dependent Raman scattering to monitor thermal phase transitions in bulk conjugated polymer samples. These procedures can be used as in situ characterization methods in a wide variety of experimental situations and offer a sensitive probe of processing protocols used in the fabrication of polymer optoelectronic devices.</jats:p>",

The current density, calculated from current–voltage (I–V) characteristics at room temperature, was 4.02×10−9 A/cm2 at an electric field of 3×105 V/m. The I–V characteristics of the films showed ohmic behavior for electric field strength lower than 1 MV/m. Nonlinearity in the current density–voltage (J–V) behavior was observed at an electric field above 1 MV/m. Different conduction mechanisms were brought into picture to explain the I–V characteristics of BBN thin films. The J–V behavior of BBN thin films was found to follow the Lampert’s theory of space charge limited conduction in an insulator with traps. Three different regions, i.e., ohmic, trap filled limited, Child’s law were explicitly observed in J–V characteristics. The activation energies in the ohmic region calculated from the Arrhenius plot were 0.46, 0.48, and 0.51 eV, respectively. These energies were attributed to the shallow traps, distributed near the conduction band edge in the forbidden gap of the materials.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The efficacy of large-eddy simulation (LES) with wall modeling for complex turbulent flows is assessed by considering turbulent boundary-layer flows past an asymmetric trailing-edge. Wall models based on turbulent boundary-layer equations and their simpler variants are employed to compute the instantaneous wall shear stress, which is used as approximate boundary conditions for the LES. It is demonstrated that, as first noted by Cabot and Moin [Flow Turb. Combust. 63, 269 (2000)], when a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes type eddy viscosity is used in the wall-layer equations with nonlinear convective terms, its value must be reduced to account for only the unresolved part of the Reynolds stress. A dynamically adjusted mixing-length eddy viscosity is used in the turbulent boundary-layer equation model, which is shown to be considerably more accurate than the simpler wall models based on the instantaneous log law. This method predicts low-order velocity statistics in good agreement with those from the full LES with resolved wall-layers, at a small fraction of the original computational cost. In particular, the unsteady separation near the trailing-edge is captured correctly, and the prediction of surface pressure fluctuations also shows promise.</jats:p>",

Here the Hamiltonian formalism is constructed and the role of standard boundary conditions is revealed for a inviscid compressible fluid with surface tension which moves in a field of the Newtonian gravitational potential. It is shown that these boundary conditions guarantee absence of singular contributions to the equations of motion, i.e., to the Hamiltonian vector field. From the other side the Hamiltonian variation contains a nonzero boundary term. Such Hamiltonians are usually treated as “nondifferentiable” or “inadmissible.” We conclude that nondifferentiable functionals can be admissible Hamiltonians for non-ultralocal Poisson brackets. We give a four-sided picture of free surface dynamics: both in Lagrangian and in Eulerian variables and also both in variational and in Hamiltonian approaches.</jats:p>",

However, this determination is affected by a large uncertainty for low Al mole fractions (x&amp;lt;0.20), due to the broadened spectral line shape exhibited by these modes. A detailed study of Raman spectra recorded on layers with x&amp;lt;0.27, grown either on sapphire or on silicon substrates, has been performed in order to elucidate the origin of that broadening. The influence on the A1(LO) line shape of the sapphire substrate modes, compositional inhomogeneities, residual strain, and those effects inherent to the lattice dynamics of ternary alloys, is analyzed. We conclude that the broadening is caused by intrinsic inhomogeneities of the microscopic polarization fields resulting from alloying. This effect is usually obscured in other III–V compounds, such as arsenides or phosphides, due to their considerably lower LO–transverse optical splitting.</jats:p>",

In order to evaluate the lattice deformation in the wurtzite heterostructures, we derived a very general expression of the x-ray incidence parameter which relates the unit cell size to the experimental diffraction peaks separation. All the strain and rotation tensors components of the heterostructures could be determined, which is essential to determine the correct chemical composition. We found a coherent interface between the GaN buffer and the AlxGa1−xN/GaN superlattice, while a partial relaxation of the InxGa1−xN/GaN superlattice with respect to the GaN buffer layer was revealed. The Al and In mole fraction of AlxGa1−xN and InxGa1−xN SL layers were determined by using Vegard’s rule and simulation of the experimental x-ray patterns.

A MgB2 sample pellet that was hot isostatic pressed (HIPed) was found to have significantly increased critical current density (Jc) at higher fields than its un-HIPed counterpart. The HIPed sample had a Jc of 10 000 A/cm2 in 50 000 Oe (5 T) at 5 K. This was 20 times higher than that of the un-HIPed sample, and the same as the best Jc reported by other research groups. Microstructures observed in scanning and transmission electron microscopy indicate that the HIP process eliminated porosity present in the MgB2 pellet resulting in an improved intergrain connectivity. Such improvement in intergrain connectivity was believed to prevent the steep Jc drop with magnetic field H that occurred in the un-HIPed MgB2 pellet at H&amp;gt;45 000 Oe(4.5 T) and T=5 K. The HIP process was also found to disperse the MgO that existed at the grain boundaries of the un-HIPed MgB2 pellet and to generate more dislocations in the pellets.

The technique is nonintrusive and, thus, simple to implement. Planar laser-induced fluorescence is employed to collect a sufficiently long sequence of instantaneous light intensity fields on the plane of section of the Poincaré map (defined by the laser sheet). The invariant sets of the flow are visualized by time-averaging the instantaneous images and plotting iso-contours of the so resulting mean light intensity field. By linking the Eulerian time averages of light intensity at fixed points in space with the Lagrangian time averages along particle paths passing through these points, we show that ergodic theory concepts can be used to show that this procedure will indeed visualize invariant sets of the Poincaré map. As the technique is based on time-averaging, we discuss the rates of convergence and show that inside regular islands the convergence is fast. An example is presented from the application of this technique to visualize the intricate web of regular islands within a steady, three-dimensional vortex breakdown bubble.</jats:p>",

A novel technique is applied where the complete three-dimensional (3D) momentum vector of a reaction product is directly determined. The kinetic energy distribution (KED) for Cl* is observed for the first time. The obtained KEDs of Cl and Cl* are different in the low kinetic energy range due to the correlating state of the partner fragment CSCl. In the case of ground state Cl the CSCl partner radical is produced in the ground X̃, Ã, and B̃ states with a contribution of 4±0.5%, 60±5%, and 36±3%, respectively. In the case of Cl* the corresponding CSCl is produced with a contribution of 7.5±0.5% in the ground X̃, 71.5±5.5% in state Ã, and 21±1.5% in state B̃. The yield of Cl*, φ(Cl*)=P(Cl*)/[P(Cl)+P(Cl*)], was found to be 0.47. No significant velocity dependence of the anisotropy parameter β could be observed.

The treatments included H2 plasma and annealing in H2/Ar, Ar, or air from 100 to 400 °C. With both types of H2 treatments, the mobility of the SnO2 having the lowest carrier density (&amp;lt;2×1020 cm−3) doubles from ∼30 to ∼60 cm2/V s while the mobilities of SnO2 materials having a higher carrier density were unaffected. There was no significant change in carrier density with either treatment for any SnO2. The visible transmission degrades significantly with H2 plasma at 200 °C but it is unaffected by H2/Ar annealing up to 400 °C. A 20 nm layer of sputtered ZnO is sufficient to protect the SnO2 from plasma-induced damage while still allowing the factor of 2 improvement in SnO2 mobility. The resistivity of bare SnO2 can be decreased by a factor of 2 without any loss of transmission using H2/Ar or Ar annealing at 400 °C without a protective ZnO layer. The changes were stable over 2 years of storage in air. Results are consistent with thermal desorption of oxygen from grain boundaries in a reducing ambient. An optimum SnO2 product for superstrate a-Si solar module fabrication should be deposited with a low carrier density, &amp;lt;2×1020 cm−3, then annealed in H2/Ar or Ar at 300–400 °C to increase the mobility without increasing the absorption losses.</jats:p>",

To realize the feedback mechanism, 2D Bragg structures formed from doubly-corrugated waveguide sections of coaxial geometry are suggested. The properties of two types of coaxial cavities formed using such structures are compared: a single-section 2D Bragg cavity and a two-mirror cavity. The eigenmodes of both cavities are found and their high selectivity over both azimuthal and longitudinal indices was demonstrated. Time-domain analyses of the excitation of the cavities by an annular electron beam were carried out. The influence of the cavity parameters on the oscillation regime is analyzed and discussed. It was shown that for a specific set of 2D Bragg cavity parameters it is possible to obtain a regime of steady-state oscillations when the transverse size of the beam exceeds the wavelength by a few orders of magnitude, while outside this parameter space multimode oscillation takes place. The design of a 2D Bragg free-electron maser oscillator based on a high-current accelerator at the University of Strathclyde is discussed.</jats:p>",

Cross-sectional samples, both normal and parallel to the growth direction of a whisker, were prepared. Precipitates of Cu6Sn5 in the grain boundaries of the finishes have been found. The growth of these grain boundary precipitates, due to the chemical reaction between Cu and Sn at room temperature, provides the driving force for spontaneous Sn whisker growth.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this work we report on a study of the mechanism of O− electron stimulated desorption (ESD) from hydrogenated and hydrogen-free polycrystalline diamond films exposed to thermally activated oxygen for incident electron energies in the 4–22 eV range. Two types of experiments were carried out in order to assess the nature of the ESD processes: (i) total O− and H− yields as a function of incident electron energy and (ii) kinetic-energy distribution (KED) of O− desorbed from the hydrogen-free diamond surface. The discussed ESD mechanism is referred to the information obtained from x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, near-edge x-ray absorption fine structure, and core level H+ photodesorption measurements which reveal formation of C=O and C–O–C bonds on the hydrogen-free diamond surface, and C=O and C–O–H bonds on the hydrogenated one. Based on the maximum kinetic-energy value of O− and the ESD threshold measured for hydrogen-free surface, all low-energy (5–10 eV) O− ions are attributed to desorption by the dissociative electron attachment (DEA) to C–O–C, while DEA to C=O occurs at the incident electron energy higher than ∼10 eV. O− ESD from the hydrogenated diamond surface exposed to thermally activated oxygen is a more complicated process. Its threshold is substantially higher than for hydrogen-free diamond, and the line shape of the ESD yield curve is very similar to that of chemisorbed CO molecules. Several reaction pathways leading to production of O− by DEA are discussed for this sample. At incident electron energies higher than ∼15 eV, O− ESD proceeds also via dipolar dissociation processes for both hydrogenated and hydrogen-free diamond surfaces.</jats:p>",

Total reaction probabilities from the initial ground state of the reagent are calculated for various values of the total angular momentum quantum number J. Reaction cross sections and rate constants are also calculated. The dynamical result from the SVRT calculation is compared with that from a pseudo atom–diatom calculation in which the HCN is treated as a pseudo diatom. Both the SVRT and pseudo atom–diatom calculations involve three degrees of freedom for the H+HCN reaction due to linearity of the HCN molecule at both reactant and transition states. The results from these two calculations are generally close to each other with some difference at high collision energies. The two models for the current system are essentially the same except that the rotational constant used is different. In particular, the SVRT model uses the correct rotational constant for the linear HCN molecule while the pseudo atom–diatom model produces a rotational constant which is much larger than the correct one.</jats:p>",

Time-resolved luminescence and absorption measurements provide evidence for a long-lived, weakly emissive species in PPV at 17 K, in addition to the luminescent singlet state. Ground state recovery times at this temperature provide evidence that up to 40% of the initially excited chromophores end up in a state that does not relax back to the ground state on the 5 ns time scale of the experiment. As the temperature is raised from 17 K to 290 K, the redshifted emission disappears, the fluorescence decay becomes more rapid, and the magnitude of the long-time bleach decreases. These results can be understood in terms of a three-level model where the initially excited singlet state decays nonradiatively via two separate channels: thermally-activated direct relaxation to the ground state, and nanosecond relaxation into a third, long-lived dark state. As the temperature increases, the thermally-activated process increases at the expense of both the fluorescence and the intermediate dark state population. Using this model, a temperature-independent dark state formation time of 1.8 ns was found for PPV, and 1.1 ns for MH-PPV. Our data and modeling provide no evidence for a subpicosecond relaxation channel in the decay of the luminescent excitons in these phenylene vinylene polymers.</jats:p>",

The dependencies of the microwave response spectrum on the bias voltage and operating temperature have been measured on samples made from YBa2Cu3O7−x films with different thicknesses. Once the bias voltage exceeds the value corresponding to the first maximum of differential resistance, the value of the −3 dB roll-off frequency of the microbridge response is drastically reduced. On the other hand, at temperatures close to Tc the roll-off frequency rises to about 20 GHz. For high resistivity YBa2Cu3O7−x films with relatively low upper critical magnetic fields the −3 dB roll-off frequency is about 7 GHz even at temperatures much smaller than Tc. To explain the results obtained we consider the presence of two additive mechanisms that contribute to the YBa2Cu3O7−x thin-film microbridge response to microwave radiation: vibration of magnetic vortices and heating of electrons and phonons. The competition between these two mechanisms defines the bias voltage and temperature dependencies of the −3 dB roll-off frequency as well as the recently reported dependence of the intermediate frequency bandwidth of YBa2Cu3O7−x hot-electron bolometer mixers on the local oscillator frequency. Numerical calculations based on this assumption are in a good qualitative agreement with the experimental results.</jats:p>",

The bond energies of Nin+–D generally increase as the cluster size increases, and parallel those for Nin+–Ni for many clusters.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In order to describe efficiently the solvation of complex solutes in computer simulations, we introduce several simple particle-based models with the requirement that they yield, on average, either an exact or approximate representation of the macroscopic laws of electrostatics. First, in a phenomenological approach, electrostatics of continuous media is formulated in terms of a polarization density free energy functional, which is projected on randomly distributed discrete Lennard-Jones pseudoparticles. The resulting model is that a polarizable fluid, in which the induced dipoles describe both orientational and electronic polarization. The problem of the connection between the macroscopic dielectric constant and the pseudoparticles polarizability is examined and important deviations with respect to the commonly accepted Clausius–Mossotti relation are found. Dipolar saturation effects can also be added to the model to yield a “nonlocal Langevin solvent model” and an approximate, numerically very efficient, “local Langevin solvent model.” The two models are implemented in molecular dynamics simulations and their solvation properties are compared to continuous electrostatics for simple solutes such as spherical ions or ion pairs. Their computational efficiency is also discussed and compared to explicit microscopic solvent models. Then a statistical mechanics approach based on orientational density functional theory ideas is presented. Starting from a microscopic Hamiltonian describing a polar solvent, and for a given position of all the solvent molecules, a preliminary thermodynamic average over all the possible orientations of the molecules is performed. This can done by defining an orientational free-energy functional which, at a formal stage, is perfectly well-defined and exact. Minimization of the functional with respect the angular degrees of freedom yields an effective Hamiltonian acting on the translational degrees of freedom only which can be explored via molecular dynamics simulations. The simplest approximation for the orientational functional yields a version of the nonlocal Langevin solvent model mentioned above. More general approximations are suggested.</jats:p>",

With this technique, uniform, box-shaped profiles are obtained, with dopant concentrations that can exceed equilibrium solubility limits at normal processing temperatures. Unfortunately, these super-saturated dopant concentrations exist in a metastable state and deactivate upon further thermal processing. In this article, we describe a comprehensive study of the deactivation kinetics of common dopants (P, B, and Sb) across a range of concentrations and annealing conditions. For comparison, As deactivation data from the literature is also presented. P and As deactivate substantially at temperatures as low as 500 °C, while Sb at moderate concentrations and B remain fully active until 700 to 800 °C. It is proposed that As and P deactivate through the formation of small dopant-defect clusters while B deactivates through precipitation.

Each spectrum was visually subdivided into a stronger (cold) spectrum and a weaker (hot) spectrum. Lines in the cold spectrum were fit to nearly experimental error, using a rotational Hamiltonian for open-shell complexes taken from the literature. For O2–DF, 21 rotational and spin–rotational parameters (10 each for the upper and lower state plus the band origin) were used to fit 86 transitions to a standard deviation of 0.0002 cm−1. For O2–HF, 23 rotational and spin–rotational parameters were used to fit 83 transitions to a standard deviation of 0.0003 cm−1. The slightly poorer quality of the fit for O2–HF than for O2–DF is probably related to the somewhat larger vibrational amplitudes expected for the van der Waals motions in the protonated species.

Using cobalt as the cluster metal we carried out a comprehensive study concerning the influence of the substrate temperature (up to 900 °C) and the effective film thickness for the carbon evaporation. With scanning tunneling microscopy in UHV at room temperature and at T=77 K we observed single, separated SWNTs of about 50 nm length, which frequently were angled or branched and included junctions between sections of different tube diameters. With a statistical evaluation of tube diameters, tube lengths, and cluster heights, we obtained new insights into the growth mechanisms. An increase of tube diameters with increasing substrate temperature and a strong catalytic activity of cobalt clusters with sizes below 4 nm is in agreement with experimental results for the gas phase growth and recent calculations for several growth mechanisms. At T=77 K the atomic structures of the SWNT were imaged together with atomic resolution on the HOPG substrate.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper we investigate the long time behavior (final state) of the Rayleigh–Bénard (RB) flow of a rarefied monatomic gas for a set of the nondimensional Knudsen and Froude numbers in the intervals Kn∈[1.0×10−3,4×10−2], Fr∈[1.0×10−1,1.5×103]. For the most part of the computations the third nondimensional parameter, the ratio of the cold and hot wall temperatures is fixed to Tc/Th=0.1, corresponding to a large temperature difference (Th serves as reference temperature), for which the RB system is believed to reach most of the possible final states (attractors). The low Knudsen numbers allow the problem to be investigated numerically by using two completely different methods: direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method (molecular approach) and finite difference (FD) method (continuum approach based on the model of compressible viscous heat conducting gas with state-dependent transport coefficients). As a result the effect of rarefaction on the onset of convection in the two-dimensional case is studied and the zone of convection is delineated. The gravitational instability of the RB system is analyzed by using the exact solution of pure-conduction state. As a result two analytical conditions for large and small Froude numbers, respectively, are suggested as exterior bounds of the zone of convection. Both DSMC and FD calculations, which are in good agreement in the considered set of the governing parameters, confirm the validity of these estimations. The observed hysteresis loops between the found out co-existing attractors within the zone of convection is another finding of the presented study. The results for the lowest Knudsen number considered (Kn=0.001), where a set of qualitatively new regimes and final states have been found, are presented separately in paper II.</jats:p>",

The important reactions contributing to film growth were identified through detailed visualization of radical–surface interaction trajectories. These reactions include (i) insertion of SiH into Si–Si bonds, (ii) adsorption onto surface dangling bonds, (iii) surface H abstraction by impinging SiH radicals through an Eley–Rideal mechanism, (iv) surface adsorption by penetration into subsurface layers or dissociation leading to interstitial atomic hydrogen, (v) desorption of interstitial hydrogen into the gas phase, (vi) formation of higher surface hydrides through the exchange of hydrogen, and (vii) dangling-bond-mediated dissociation of surface hydrides into monohydrides. The MD simulations of a-Si:H film growth predict an overall surface reaction probability of 95% for the SiH radical that is in good agreement with experimental measurements. Structural and chemical characterization of the deposited films was based on the detailed analysis of evolution of the films’ structure, surface morphology and roughness, surface reactivity, and surface composition. The analysis revealed that the deposited films exhibit high dangling bond densities and rough surface morphologies.

A high contact resistance not only increases the RC delay but also causes extra Joule heating. However, it is extremely difficult to measure the temperature at a tiny contact using conventional methods. This paper presents a method of direct measurement of contact temperature using four-terminal Kelvin test structures of metal in contact with Si. The temperature at the contact can be determined from the builtup Seebeck potential in the Kelvin circuit during electrical stressing once the relative Seebeck coefficient of the metallization with respect to Si is known. The Seebeck potential is extracted from the voltage measurement across the contacts.

Formamide and thioformamide dimers were both found to exhibit five different minima on their potential surfaces involving hydrogen bonds of the N–H⋯X=C or C–H⋯X=C (X=O, S) type. The most stable structure in both cases is a cyclic configuration of C2h symmetry involving two identical N–H⋯X=C bonds. The interaction energy for such a structure is −60 and −48 kJ/mol for formamide and thioformamide, respectively. Based on the calculations, each N–H⋯X=C bond contributes −30 kJ/mol to it in formamide and −24 kJ/mol in thioformamide. On the other hand, each N–H⋯X=C bond contributes −9.7 kJ/mol in formamide and −11.7 kJ/mol in thioformamide. The interaction causes appreciable distortion in the molecules, particularly in the N–H groups involved in a hydrogen bond, which are lengthened by up to 0.019 and 0.013 Å in formamide and thioformamide, respectively. The trimer structures identified on the potential surfaces of formamide and thioformamide are cyclic configurations capable of establishing 3 or 4 hydrogen bonds. While formamide tends to adopt planar configurations (the most stable of which possesses an interaction energy of −105 kJ/mol), thioformamide forms preferentially nonplanar structures (the most stable being a nonplanar cyclic configuration with an interaction energy of −88 kJ/mol). The contribution of nonadditive pairwise terms is not particularly significant in either compound, which suggests the absence of substantial cooperative phenomena in the trimers. However, this contribution is crucial with a view to determining the stability sequence for the trimers, where the most stable structures result from the contribution of nonadditive pairwise terms (up to 15% of the overall interaction energy for the most stable thioformamide trimer). The interaction shifts the frequencies of modes closely involved in it. Thus, the N–H symmetric stretching frequency is redshifted by more than 300 cm−1 and the NH2 wagging frequency is blueshifted to a similar extent. As a rule, frequency shifts are less marked in the thioformamide clusters; both substances, however, exhibit identical trends.</jats:p>",

In our formulation, all molecular integrals are expressed in terms of ACH. Therefore, the formulations have wide applicability for calculating various kinds of molecular integrals in ab initio calculations.

As the magnitude of the toroidal flow approaches the sound speed, the n=1 resistive tearing mode can be completely stabilized by the flow, eliminating sawteeth.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Direct tunneling gate leakage current in metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) structures with ultrathin gate oxides is studied. The effects of inelastic scattering of inversion carriers in the gate-oxide region is taken into account in the current calculation. Open boundary conditions, incorporating the effects of wave function penetration into the gate oxide, are used to solve Schrödinger’s equation. The proposed technique, based on the Green’s function formalism, is numerically efficient and does not require determination of complex eigenenergies of a non-Hermitian matrix. Self-consistent calculations for n-type MOS devices are compared with experimental results. Excellent agreement between simulated and measured data is obtained when appropriate spatial and gate bias dependence of the inelastic scattering rate is taken into account. It is shown that due to inelastic scattering, at low gate voltages, the gate current increases significantly in devices with oxide thickness equal to 2 nm or higher. However, when the oxide thickness is reduced below 2 nm, inelastic scattering has no significant effect on gate current. The existing mismatch at lower gate voltages between experimental and modeled direct tunneling currents in devices with gate-oxide width equal to or greater than 2 nm is explained in terms of inelastic scattering effects.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The main feature of polymeric materials is the hierarchy of bonds between molecular groups. This feature is explicitly taken into account in a model of photothermal laser ablation of polymers derived in the present work. According to this model the reason for laser ablation is a photothermal bond-breaking reaction within the bulk of material originated from laser heating. In order to address the movement of the interface between gaseous and condensed phases, we change the Stefan-like boundary condition considered previously for the Frenkel–Wilson one. In the latter case the activation energy for elimination of a short enough polymer chain from the surface is proportional to the sum of the energies of weak bonds connecting this chain with the surface. We compare predictions of this model with the previously derived Stefan-like bulk model and with the surface photothermal evaporation model with respect to kinetics and dynamics of laser ablation by both nanosecond and subpicosecond pulses, including ablation by two subpicosecond pulses. This consideration suggests experimental evidence that allows one to distinguish between surface and bulk photothermal ablation mechanisms. The parameters used in numerical calculation correspond to the KrF excimer laser ablation of polyimide. The results of the theoretical modeling are compared with the existing data on kinetics of nanosecond laser ablation as well as with findings of time-resolved UV subpicosecond laser ablation experiments.</jats:p>",

The time difference between the maximum of excimer emission and that of resonant atomic emission is measured at high Xe concentration. The decay time of the overall VUV emission decreases strongly as the Xe concentration increases due to three-body collisions leading to Xe2 formation. The decay time constants versus Xe concentration and pressure are measured and compared with published rate constants.

Transmission of ions to the bottom of the holes increases with increasing ion energy and decreases as the sheath size becomes comparable to the hole size. Ion energy distributions at the bottom of the holes are narrower than distributions on the flat wafer surface. The flux of ions remains normal to the wafer surface over most of the hole area but the flux of ions within 6 μm of the wall is angled towards the wall. The observed trends are consistent with effects expected due to bowing of the plasma sheath around the surface features on the wafer.

Polarization and charge–quadrupole energies of single charges and of CT configurations in perfect crystals and of single charges near vacancies are recalculated treating anthracene as 14 submolecules at the heavy atoms, rather than three at the centers of the rings as in previous work. This improves agreement with experiment. A vacancy adjacent to either of the two lowest-energy CT configurations reduces the dielectric screening of the Coulomb stabilization, thereby stabilizing the configuration by typically 20–50 meV. However, for some higher-energy CT configurations a vacancy on or near the CT axis can actually increase the screening and destabilize the configuration by up to 40 meV. A vacancy also changes the charge–quadrupole energy by as much as ±250 meV, so that this effect dominates (as for single charges), leading to traps as deep as 300 meV for the two lowest-energy CT configurations. Such traps could reduce the efficiency of charge-carrier photogeneration by enhancing geminate recombination of CT configurations.</jats:p>",

This result is in qualitative agreement with self-consistent band profile calculations taking into account both band gap deformation potentials and piezoelectric polarization charges in these structures. However, the reduction of the polarization induced quantum-confined Stark effect is well in excess of that conventionally calculated for this material system. We attribute this observation to a substantial deviation of the piezoelectric polarization constants of strained layers from those calculated for unstrained material. This finding is shown to be in agreement with recent calculations of the piezoelectric polarization charges for biaxially strained (Al,Ga,In)N layers.</jats:p>",

Lett. 83, 5058 (1999); 84, 1848 (2000)], which we extend here to an explicit three-dimensional treatment. Three plausible helium densities are reconstructed by interpolation of previously published “density cuts” in terms of an expansion into cubic harmonics (several interpolation strategies are presented). This allows us to predict a value of ΔI that ranges from as low as 30 u⋅Å2 to as high as 318 u⋅Å2. The lower limit reproduces the prediction of Kwon et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 113, 6469 (2000)], who use the same hydrodynamic model and an unpublished density based upon a Path Integral Monte Carlo calculation. These values can be compared with the experimentally measured ΔI (310±10 u⋅Å2) for large (N⩾103 He atoms), and with Fixed Node, Diffusion Monte Carlo calculations by Lee, Farrelly, and Whaley [Phys. Rev. Lett. 83, 3812 (1999)], which found ΔI=290–305 u⋅Å2 for N=8–20 helium atoms. The present results show that the value of ΔI obtained from the hydrodynamic model is quite sensitive to physically reasonable variations in the helium density; therefore one has to be careful as to which density to use. Because the model is based upon the assumption that the helium is in the ground “quasienergy” state of the helium-molecule time-dependent potential, we propose that calculations should be done using densities calculated at 0 K rather than at finite temperature. We have extended our original algorithm to also handle irregular boundaries. We find that in the present case the calculated value of ΔI only changes by a few percent.</jats:p>",

The latter occurs when the stress p is larger than a certain critical value pc, satisfying pcR2=constant (R=effective pore radius), where the constant is an increasing function of elastic modulus of the gel and its cross-linking energy. The expulsion of the gel above pc is reminiscent of growing Saffman-Taylor instabilities. To derive analytic expressions for the macroscopic saturation profiles we use the formalism for fully miscible two-phase flow. The equation of evolution of the pressure, established by mass balance arguments, was solved analytically. For p&amp;lt;pc, the pressure obeys an exponential saturation function while for p&amp;lt;pc, it first increases, reaches a maximum value, and then decreases towards an asymptotic value. These theoretical predictions are supported by our experiments consisting of injecting (salt) water at a constant flow rate in porous samples containing a organically cross-linked polymer gel (co-polymer of acrylamide and t-butyl-acrylate cross-linked using poly-ethylene-imine). The data confirms further that the product pcR2 is constant and prove that both pc and the maximum pressures increase with intrinsic gel strength.</jats:p>",

The seed gas, tetrakis(dimethylamino)ethylene, which has an ionization potential of 6.1 eV is ionized by an ultraviolet laser through 6.4 eV photon absorption, and forms a plasma column inside a vacuum chamber. The plasma absorbs additional power through inductive coupling of 13.56 MHz helical antenna radio frequency wave fields to the plasma through electron acceleration, ionization, and collisional damping. Laser initiation of 2–6 mTorr of the seed gas in 1–150 Torr of argon is accomplished and produces steady-state line-average plasma densities of ne≈4×1012 cm−3 in a volume of 300 cm3. The two-body recombination coefficient of the organic seed gas and its optimum partial pressure when mixed with argon are experimentally determined and analyzed.

The thin film deposition of Ta(N) by physical vapor deposition on porous films with different average pore sizes and material compositions has been studied. The continuity of Ta(N) films on top of porous low-k dielectrics is evaluated by means of ellipsometric porosimetry combined with sheet resistance and atomic force microscopy measurements. Interface reactions are analyzed by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy profiling. It has been observed that the minimal Ta(N) thickness required to obtain a continuous metal layer on top of the porous film depends, on the one hand, on the porosity and pore size and, on the other hand, on the chemical interaction of the thin film with the porous substrate. The sealing of pores is favored by the presence of carbon in the dielectric matrix. This is explained through a mechanism of local enhancement of the degree of crosslinking in the dielectric matrix, catalyzed by Ta.</jats:p>",

The dependence of the light scattering by the gold nanoparticle on the wavelength, the shape, and the surrounding medium dielectric profile are theoretically described and experimentally investigated, demonstrating that the tuning of the particle’s size and shape plays a crucial role in the light scattering process. In the case of gold spherical nanostructures, the plasmon resonance occurs at 540 nm in air, and 600 nm in water. A higher surrounding medium refraction index leads to a redshift of the plasmon resonance in the gold particle. Moreover, for elliptical structures, the orientation of the polarization of the incident field, as well as the relative ratio of the ellipse dimensions along its main axis, govern the position of the plasmon resonances. The light transmission spectrum for several probes where a single elliptical gold particle has been grafted exhibits at least one resonance in the range 600–650 nm. Surface plasmon resonances are of importance for the field enhancement at the end of the modified tip, thus leading to improvement of the achievable resolution for near field optical microscopy. An optimized design of the metallic nanostructure deposited at the apex of the near field probe is needed to maximize the resonance and would therefore lead to a high-performance probe for scanning near field optical microscopy.</jats:p>",

Both quantities scale as powers of N:τ∼Nz and D∼1/Nx with the asymptotic exponents z=3 and x=2, in agreement with the reptation theory.

Elastic first-order diffraction and rotationally inelastic diffraction peaks were observed over the whole incident energy range explored. The elastic diffraction data could be fitted using the simple Eikonal approximation only over a very narrow range of incident energies. Similarly, a Debye–Waller-type attenuation of diffraction intensities as a function of surface temperature was only verified at low incident energies (∼100 meV). The absolute 0→2 transition probability was found to increase from 10 to 20% in the energy range investigated, whereas the one corresponding to the 2→0 transition remained constant at 10%.

The ability of this approach to generate reliable potential energy curves (PECs) or surfaces over a wide range of geometries is examined using a realistic ab initio model of the HF molecule. The PECs obtained with the correlation-consistent polarized valence double (triple, quadruple) zeta cc-pVXZ (T,Q) basis sets are used, together with the PEC extrapolated to the complete basis set limit, to compute the rotational and vibrational levels, which are then compared with the experimentally determined values as well as with the directly measured vibrational frequencies. A comparison is also made with the earlier results [X. Li, J. Mol. Struct.: THEOCHEM 547, 69 (2001)] that were obtained with the amplitude-corrected CCSD method, namely the so-called reduced MR CCSD that exploits the same MR CISD wave function, as well as with recently published renormalized CCSD(T) results [P.

It is based on the semiclassical theory including recently derived corrections and it is the first method, which explicitly takes into account the whole conformational space between the minima and the transition state. The density-functional theory is used to determine the qualitative shape of the potential energy surface (PES) and high level ab initio calculations provide information about the stationary points. With a dual level scheme, the low-level energy surface is mapped onto the high-level points to get a good quantitative description of the high-level PES. Therefore, the new method requires no adjustment of additional parameters like scaling of the energy barrier as is necessary in other methods. Once the high-level PES is calculated, the most probable tunneling paths are determined with a global optimization procedure. Along this representative tunneling path, the tunneling splitting is calculated with additional consideration of zero-point vibrational effects. The method is applied to three molecular systems, namely hydrofluoric acid dimer, malonaldehyde, and tropolone. These systems were chosen because their energy barriers differ strongly (1 kcal/mol–7 kcal/mol). The predicted tunneling splittings agree very well with the experimental ones, therefore, we expect our method to be generally applicable, independent of the magnitude of the energy barrier.</jats:p>",

The PL spectra from the bilayer structure contain no Alq contribution when its thickness is below 2.4 nm. Taking the value as the maximum distance for which the Alq exciton can travel in the film and still transfer its energy to a DCM molecule, the minimum DCM concentration in Alq:DCM necessary to produce red emission only can be estimated at 0.31 wt %. The most efficient red emission appears at the DCM concentration of about 1.7 wt %, at which more than 90% Alq-originated excitons are involved in the Förster energy transfer process.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The radial local dynamics in poly(1,4-trans-butadiene) melts is studied using molecular dynamics simulations. In this work, the hopping peak is observed in the Van Hove space-time correlation function Gs(r,t) for the first time in polymeric systems. The hopping motion, observed only for methine hydrogen, is also identified in the mean-square displacement 〈Δr2(t)〉 and the intermediate scattering function Fs(k,t) through the relative dynamics of the hopping methine hydrogen and the nonhopping methylene hydrogen. The hopping motion is found to cause an unusual broadening of the dispersion width in the dynamic structure factor Sinc(k,ω). Active free volume is proposed in terms of Gs(r,t) at a short time, which offers a consistency to the relationship between free volume and local dynamics. Fast counterrotation at a pair of CH–CH2 bonds across a CH=CH bond is found responsible for the hopping peak in this polymer, and a new hopping criterion modified for polymeric liquids is proposed.</jats:p>",

The Fe concentration in the film showed a linear dependence on the precursor partial pressure, and was insensitive to growth temperature, pressure, and ammonia partial pressure.

A 2.6-μm-thick GaN film with a resistivity of 7×109 Ω/sq was attained when the first 0.3 μm of the film was Fe doped. X-ray diffraction rocking curves indicated high crystalline quality, very similar to an undoped film, showing that Fe doping did not affect the structural properties of the film.

Photoions produced from a singlet state are always unpolarized regardless of the laser polarization and a magnetic sublevel from which ionization takes place. We carry out specific analysis for both schemes with Sr atoms, and find 85%–90% and 66% polarizations for the former and the latter schemes, respectively, if the wavelengths and polarizations of lasers are judiciously chosen. In particular, if all the produced photoions are in the ground s state, we find an exact one-to-one correspondence between the spin-polarization of photoions and ejected photoelectrons.</jats:p>",

A system of kinetic equations taking into account the accumulation of charge on the molecule is solved, and an exact formula for the steady-state current is obtained for the first time. In the low-temperature limit the steps on the I–V characteristic are analyzed and found to be nonequidistant with respect to current. It is shown that with increasing degeneracy of the level the initial current steps tend toward a completely equidistant spacing. In the case when the coupling parameters between the molecule and external electrodes are substantially different, the behavior of the I–V curves on parts with opposite directions of the current is found to be different: either a single current step is formed, with an amplitude proportional to the degeneracy of the level, or equidistant current steps appear in a number equal to the degeneracy of the level. It is shown that for a given polarity of the applied voltage, the matter of which of the two behaviors of the current is realized is completely conditional on whether the level via which the electron transport occurs is occupied or unoccupied by electrons.

The kinetic effects are investigated in detail near the boundaries of the hysteresis, where they are most clearly expressed. Less clear signs of the structural transformation are observed on the temperature dependence of the microhardness of the alloy. It is found that the structural transformation is governed by thermally activated processes with several characteristic relaxation times: the analytical form of the kinetic curves and the temperature dependence of the relaxation times are substantially different for the direct (on cooling) and reverse (on heating) transformations. Similarities and differences between this transformation and the known structural rearrangement processes in the physics of alloys are discussed.

The results show that although the amorphous layer in preamorphized silicon can be completely annealed by laser irradiation, the end-of-range damages were not sufficiently annealed. The end-of-range region contains a supersaturation of interstitial defects that enhance the diffusion of boron during a post-laser processing anneal. It is found that the transient enhanced diffusion is significantly suppressed when the melt depth is extended beyond the amorphous layer such that the interstitial dose in the region adjacent to the laser-melted layer is minimized. In this way, the abruptness of laser-processed ultrashallow junctions can be maintained upon further annealing at moderately high temperatures. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy shows that a virtually defect-free regrown layer is obtained by overmelting beyond the amorphous layer into the substrate.</jats:p>",

However, it is well known that the resolution and optical sectioning ability can be severely degraded by system or specimen-induced aberrations. The use of high aperture lenses further exacerbates the problem. Moreover, aberrations can considerably reduce the number of photons that reach the detector, leading to lower contrast. It is rather unfortunate, therefore, that in practical microscopy, aberration-free confocal imaging is rarely achieved. Adaptive optics systems, which have been used widely to correct aberrations in astronomy, offer a solution here but also present new challenges. The optical system and the source of aberrations in a confocal microscope are considerably different and require a novel approach to wavefront sensing. This method, based upon direct measurement of Zernike aberration modes, also exhibits an axial selectivity similar to that of a confocal microscope. We demonstrate an adaptive confocal fluorescence microscope incorporating this modal sensor together with a deformable membrane mirror for aberration correction. Aberration corrected images of biological specimens show considerable improvement in contrast and apparent restoration of axial resolution.</jats:p>",

This type of social organization is not only a key attribute responsible for the ecological domination of these ants, but also an evolutionary paradox and a potential problem for kin selection theory because relatedness between nest mates is effectively zero. The introduction of the Argentine ant in Europe was apparently accompanied by a dramatic loss of inter-nest aggression and the formation of two immense supercolonies (which effectively are two unicolonial populations). Introduced populations experienced only limited loss of genetic diversity at neutral markers, indicating that the breakdown of recognition ability is unlikely to be merely due to a genetic bottleneck. Rather, we suggest that a “genetic cleansing” of recognition cues occurred after introduction. Indeed workers of the same supercolony are never aggressive to each other despite the large geographical distance and considerable genetic differentiation between sampling sites. By contrast, aggression is invariably extremely high between the two supercolonies, indicating that they have become fixed for different recognition alleles. The main supercolony, which ranges over 6,000 km from Italy to the Spanish Atlantic coast, effectively forms the largest cooperative unit ever recorded.</jats:p>",

Erg28p was also shown to reciprocally coimmunoprecipitate with Erg27p. However, no coimmunoprecipitation was observed with Erg26p, most likely because of the poor solubilization of this protein. Sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation studies suggested that Erg25p/Erg26p/Erg27p/Erg28p, along with other proteins in sterol biosynthesis, might form a complex between 66 and 200 kDa. Using an anti-HA column with Erg27p-HA and Erg26p-HA as target proteins, a complex containing Erg25p/Erg26p/Erg27p/Erg28p was identified. Thus, we suggest that Erg28p works as a transmembrane scaffold to tether Erg27p and possibly other C-4 demethylation proteins (Erg25p, Erg26p), forming a demethylation complex in the endoplasmic reticulum.\n          </jats:p>",

In the present paper, we have defined the meaning of dome formation in relation to mammary development, by showing that treatment of LA7 cells with the lactogenic hormones hydrocortisone and prolactin induces dome formation; in the animal, these hormones precede and accompany milk production.

Plks have been reported to mediate multiple mitotic processes, including bipolar spindle formation, activation of Cdc25C, actin ring formation, centrosome maturation, and activation of the anaphase-promoting complex. To investigate its functions in mammalian cells further, we used the recently developed small interfering RNA technique specifically to deplete Plk1 in cultured cells. We find that Plk1 depletion results in elevated Cdc2 protein kinase activity and thus attenuates cell-cycle progression. About 45% of cells treated with Plk1 small interfering RNA show the formation of a dumbbell-like DNA organization, suggesting that sister chromatids are not completely separated. About 15% of these cells do complete anaphase but do not complete cytokinesis. Finally, Plk1 depletion significantly reduces centrosome amplification in hydroxyurea-treated U2OS cells.

The ends of the linear DNA form of the HIV-1 genome are defined by the specific RNase H cleavages that remove the plus- and minus-strand primers; these ends can be joined to form two-long-terminal repeat circles. Analysis of two-long-terminal repeat circle junctions showed that mutations in the RNase H domain affect the specificity of RNase H cleavage.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Ultrasound induced improvement in optical coherence tomography (OCT) resolution",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>\n            Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a rapidly emerging technology for high-resolution biomedical imaging. The axial resolution of this technology is determined by the bandwidth of the source. Commercial sources generally provide resolutions of 10–20 μm whereas laboratory-based solid state lasers have resolutions of ≈4 μm. The resolution in tissue depends almost exclusively on detecting single scattered events. However, the phenomenon known as multiple scattering results in a deterioration of resolution as a function of depth. In this study, OCT was combined with ultrasound in an attempt to reduce the effect of multiple scattering. The theory is that, with parallel ultrasound and OCT beams, multiply scattered light with a momentum component significantly perpendicular to the OCT beam will be reduced because the light is Doppler shifted outside the bandpass filter of the OCT detection electronics. A 7.5-MHz ultrasound transducer was used to introduce the photon/phonon interaction. A reflecting metal plate was placed within biological tissue, and the point spread function (PSF) was assessed off the reflector. The PSF was determined in the presence of no ultrasound, pulsed ultrasound, and continuous-wave (CW) ultrasound. CW ultrasound resulted in a 17% improvement (\n            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>\n            &lt; 0.001) in resolution and pulsed ultrasound resulted in 8% (\n            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>\n            &lt; 0.01). Image noise reduction could also be noted. Combining OCT with a parallel ultrasound beam results in an improvement in resolution through a reduced effect of multiple scattering due to photon/phonon interaction. With higher frequencies, better control of the acoustical beam, and tests in media with higher rates of multiple scattering, improved results are anticipated.\n          </jats:p>",

    "title": "A protein kinase B-dependent and rapamycin-sensitive pathway controls skeletal muscle growth but not fiber type specification",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Nerve activity controls fiber size and fiber type in skeletal muscle, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. We have previously shown that Ras–mitogen-activated protein kinase and calcineurin control fiber type but not fiber size in regenerating rat skeletal muscle. Here we report that constitutively active protein kinase B (PKB), also known as Akt, increases fiber size and prevents denervation atrophy in regenerating and adult rat muscles but does not affect fiber type profile. The coexistence of hypertrophic muscle fibers overexpressing activated PKB with normal-size untransfected fibers within the same muscle points to a cell-autonomous control of muscle growth by PKB. The physiological role of this pathway is confirmed by the finding that PKB kinase activity and phosphorylation status are significantly increased in innervated compared with denervated regenerating muscles in parallel with muscle growth. Muscle fiber hypertrophy induced by activated PKB and by a Ras double mutant (RasV12C40) that activates selectively the phosphoinositide 3-kinase–PKB pathway is completely blocked by rapamycin, showing that the mammalian target of rapamycin kinase is the major downstream effector of this pathway in the control of muscle fiber size. On the other hand, nerve activity-dependent growth of regenerating muscle is only partially inhibited by dominant negative PKB and rapamycin, suggesting that other nerve-dependent signaling pathways are involved in muscle growth. The present results support the notion that fiber size and fiber type are regulated by nerve activity through different mechanisms.</jats:p>",

In contrast, stable expression of UBP45 completely blocked both of the myogenic processes but that of inactive enzyme did not, indicating that the catalytic activity of the enzyme is essential for its inhibitory effects.

Modifications that weaken these cross-dimer contacts destabilize the quaternary T tetramer, leading to decreased cooperativity and enhanced ligand affinity, as demonstrated in many studies on symmetric double modifications, i.e., a residue site modified in both α- or both β-subunits. In this work, hybrid tetramers have been prepared with only one modified residue, yielding molecules composed of a wild-type dimer and a modified dimer. It is observed that the cooperative free energy of ligation to the modified dimer is perturbed to the same extent whether in the hybrid tetramer or in the doubly modified tetramer. The cooperative free energy of ligation to the wild-type dimer is unperturbed, even in the hybrid tetramer, and despite the overall destabilization of the T tetramer by the modification. This asymmetric response by the two dimers within the same tetramer shows that loss of dimer–dimer contacts is not communicated across the dimer–dimer interface, but is transmitted through the dimer that bears the modified residue. These observations are interpreted in terms of a previously proposed dimer-based model of cooperativity with an additional quaternary (T/R) component.</jats:p>",

Expression of Bcl-X<jats:sub>L</jats:sub>led to a decreased induction of both NFATc2 DNA binding to the IP<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>R promoter and IP<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>R expression in response to the inhibition of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. The Bcl-X<jats:sub>L</jats:sub>-dependent decrease in IP<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>R expression also correlated with a reduced T cell antigen receptor ligation-induced Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>flux in Bcl-X<jats:sub>L</jats:sub>transgenic murine T cells, and microsomal vesicles prepared from Bcl-X<jats:sub>L</jats:sub>-overexpressing cells exhibited lower IP<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>-mediated Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>release capacity. Furthermore, reintroducing IP<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>R into Bcl-X<jats:sub>L</jats:sub>-transfected cells partially reversed Bcl-X<jats:sub>L</jats:sub>-dependent anti-apoptotic activity. These results suggest that even under non-apoptotic conditions, expression of Bcl-2-family proteins influences a signaling network that links changes in mitochondrial metabolism to alterations in nuclear gene expression.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Role of the E1A Rb-binding domain in repression of the NF-κB-dependent defense against tumor necrosis factor-α",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>The adenoviral E1A oncogene sensitizes mammalian cells to tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), in part by repressing the nuclear factor-κ B (NF-κB)-dependent defense against this cytokine. Other E1A activities involve binding to either p300/cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CBP) or retinoblastoma (Rb)-family proteins, but the roles of E1A interactions with these transcriptional regulators in sensitizing cells to TNF-α are unclear. E1A expression did not block upstream events in TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB in NIH 3T3 cells, including degradation of IκB-α, nuclear translocation of NF-κB subunits, and their dimeric binding to κB sequences in the nucleus. However, E1A markedly repressed NF-κB-dependent transcription and sensitized cells to TNF-αinduced apoptosis. These E1A effects were selective for κB-dependent transcription and for the function of the NF-κB p65/RelA subunit. A four amino acid E1A deletion that eliminates binding to Rb-family proteins blocked both repression of TNF-α-induced transcription and sensitization to apoptosis. In contrast, mutations that eliminate E1A binding to p300/CBP (coactivators of p65/RelA) did not affect either E1A activity. These data suggest that E1A-Rb-binding blocks the NF-κB-dependent activation response to TNF-α by altering the function of p65/RelA at a stage after formation of the transcription factor-enhancer complex. These observations also open questions about the general role of Rb-family proteins in modulation of NF-κB-dependent transcription.</jats:p>",

Temperatures for a particularly hot (1976) and a particularly cold (1986) year were interpolated to a grid resolution of 1 km. Estimates were made of the timing of spring emergence (<jats:italic>Cecidophyopsis ribis</jats:italic> (Westwood)), the maximum number of generations completed during the summer (<jats:italic>Plutella xylostella</jats:italic> (Linnaeus)) and the numbers of days when mating was possible (<jats:italic>Merodon equestris</jats:italic> (Fabricius)). The relative accuracy of the two temperature estimation methods was compared using jack-knife cross-validation. For <jats:italic>C. ribis</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>P. xylostella</jats:italic>, modelling with interpolated temperature input data was more accurate than using data from the ‘nearest station’. Of the three phenology models used, the one that relied on an activity threshold (<jats:italic>M. equestris</jats:italic>) was the most sensitive to both types of input data. Spatial variability in the activity of <jats:italic>M. equestris</jats:italic> adults was investigated in the two main areas (south-west peninsula and Lincolnshire) where its host crop (<jats:italic>Narcissus</jats:italic>) is grown. Modelling at cruder scales (up to 25*25 km) masked local variation, but the degree to which this was important varied from region to region and over time, as did the geography of the variability itself. The results indicate that interpolated data, computed to a resolution of 1 km using the UK synoptic network, have the potential for wider use within agricultural decision support systems for horticultural crops.</jats:p>",

    "title": "How international is psychology?",
    "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:italic>P</jats:italic>sychology claims to be an international discipline. This claim has been based upon subjective estimates of attendance at international congresses, status reports from selected countries published within edited volumes, and a survey of the member countries of the International Union of Psychological Science (IUPsyS) (Rosenzweig, 1992). However, to be truly international, the work of psychologists in countries around the world must be internationally disseminated. Systematic examination of international congress presentations and abstracts of published psychological literature indexed on widely available electronic databases (e.g., PsycLIT) provides a more objective means of documenting the international presence of psychology. In this article, counts by country were made of research contributions reported within PsycLIT and on the programs of International Congresses of Applied Psychology over the five years in which the congresses were held from 1982 to 1998. Analyses of these data revealed PsycLIT to be more international in scope than previously assumed—45% of its entries were by authors from outside the US. Coverage of research from developing countries was even more limited within PsycLIT (4.67%), but proportionally greater within international congresses (10%). PsycLIT entries not in the English language were found noticeably to have declined from approximately 12–14% levels in the 1980s to only about 6% in the 1990s. An index of the presence of psychology in each country, based upon presentations at IAAP congresses, memberships in international associations, and the extent of PsycLIT entries over the previous three decades, provided an objective, empirically‐based answer to the question ‘How International is Psychology?' This index indicated that psychology has a significant presence in 47 countries, a presence in another 22 countries, but minimal or no presence in 82 other countries. The meaning of these data for the discipline and ways in which psychology's worldwide presence might be strengthened and extended were discussed.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:italic>T</jats:italic>he experiences of African communities are significantly underrepresented in the current psychological literature as compared to those of Western European and North American communities. Professional psychology in sub‐Saharan African is either nonexistent or strongly modeled after practices in North America and Western Europe. The modeling of psychology in sub‐Saharan Africa on the North American and Western European experience is a result of the more extensive marketing of the Western cultural heritage around the globe by national governments, education institutions and international aid agencies vis a vis the marketing of alternative cultural heritages. It is also reflective of the historically unequal intercultural exchanges between Western and African cultural heritages and in favour of the former. A greater representation of the African experience in the psychological literature could add to the richness and global relevance of psychology.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> We have recently shown that children interpret conditional sentences with binary terms (e.g., male/female) in both the antecedent and the consequent as biconditionals (Barrouillet &amp; Lecas, 1998). We hypothesized that the same effect can be obtained with conditionals that do not contain binary terms provided that they are embedded in a context that restricts to only two the possible values on both the antecedent and the consequent. In the present experiment, we asked 12-year-old children, 15-year-old children, and adults to draw conclusions from conditional syllogisms that involved three types of conditional sentence: (1) conditionals with binary terms (BB), (2) conditionals with non-binary terms (NN), and (3) conditionals with non-binary terms embedded in a restrictive context (NNR). As we predicted, BB conditionals elicited more biconditional response patterns than did NN conditionals in all age groups. On the other hand, manipulating the context had the same effect in children but not in adults. Content and context constraints on conditional reasoning along with developmental issues are discussed within the framework of the mental models theory. </jats:p>",

In each experiment participants made speeded left or right key-press responses to the colour of a target that followed a cueing display consisting of several shapes. The target appeared within some shapes and not others. The target's spatial code as measured by a Simon task was its location relative to possible target positions and relative to the centre of the display. Target location was not coded relative to the positions of onset shapes that could not contain a target. These spatial coding effects were found at cue-target intervals of 50, 300, and 1000 ms. The data indicate that target location is defined relative to the distribution of endogenous attention and reference frames aligned with the centre of the display and that the spatial code assigned to a target is not affected when attention is shifted in the target's direction. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) plays an important role in the generation of cytosolic Ca2+ signals in many cell types. However, it is inherently difficult to distinguish experimentally between the contributions of messenger-induced Ca2+ release and CICR. We have directly tested the CICR sensitivity of different regions of intact pancreatic acinar cells using local uncaging of caged Ca2+. In the apical region, local uncaging of Ca2+ was able to trigger a CICR wave, which propagated toward the base. CICR could not be triggered in the basal region, despite the known presence of ryanodine receptors. The triggering of CICR from the apical region was inhibited by a pharmacological block of ryanodine or inositol trisphosphate receptors, indicating that global signals require coordinated Ca2+ release. Subthreshold agonist stimulation increased the probability of triggering CICR by apical uncaging, and uncaging-induced CICR could activate long-lasting Ca2+ oscillations. However, with subthreshold stimulation, CICR could still not be initiated in the basal region. CICR is the major process responsible for global Ca2+ transients, and intracellular variations in sensitivity to CICR predetermine the activation pattern of Ca2+ waves.</jats:p>",

We show here that the proximal region of mouse prostatic ducts is enriched in a subpopulation of epithelial cells that exhibit three important attributes of epithelial stem cells: they are slow cycling, possess a high in vitro proliferative potential, and can reconstitute highly branched glandular ductal structures in collagen gels. We propose a model of prostatic homeostasis in which mouse prostatic epithelial stem cells are concentrated in the proximal region of prostatic ducts while the transit-amplifying cells occupy the distal region of the ducts. This model can account for many biological differences between cells of the proximal and distal regions, and has implications for prostatic disease formation.</jats:p>",

Here we show that p21Cip1/WAF1 is induced in the cytoplasm during the course of differentiation of chick retinal precursor cells and N1E-115 cells. Ectopic expression of p21Cip1/WAF1 lacking the nuclear localization signal in N1E-115 cells and NIH3T3 cells affects the formation of actin structures, characteristic of inactivation of Rho. p21Cip1/WAF1 forms a complex with Rho-kinase and inhibits its activity in vitro and in vivo. Neurite outgrowth and branching from the hippocampal neurons are promoted if p21Cip1/WAF1 is expressed abundantly in the cytoplasm. These results suggest that cytoplasmic p21Cip1/WAF1 may contribute to the developmental process of the newborn neurons that extend axons and dendrites into target regions.</jats:p>",

Bcl-xγ is a member of the Bcl-x family whose expression is restricted to activated T cells and requires CD28-dependent ligation for full expression. We report that Bcl-xγ–deficient (Bcl-xγ−/−) T cells display defective proliferative and cytokine responses to CD28-dependent costimulatory signals, impaired memory responses to proteolipid protein peptide (PLP), and do not develop PLP-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In contrast, enforced expression of Bcl-xγ largely replaces the requirement for B7-dependent ligation of CD28. These findings identify the Bcl-xγ cytosolic protein as an essential downstream link in the CD28-dependent signaling pathway that underlies T cell costimulation.</jats:p>",

Here, we determined recombinant AFAP-110 (rAFAP-110)-bound actin filaments cooperatively, through a lateral association. We demonstrate rAFAP-110 has the capability to cross-link actin filaments, and this ability is dependent on the integrity of the carboxy terminal actin binding domain. Deletion of the leucine zipper motif or PKC phosphorylation affected AFAP-110's conformation, which correlated with changes in multimerization and increased the capability of rAFAP-110 to cross-link actin filaments. AFAP-110 is both a substrate and binding partner of PKC. On PKC activation, stress filament organization is lost, motility structures form, and AFAP-110 colocalizes strongly with motility structures. Expression of a deletion mutant of AFAP-110 that is unable to bind PKC blocked the effect of PMA on actin filaments. We hypothesize that upon PKC activation, AFAP-110 can be cooperatively recruited to newly forming actin filaments, like those that exist in cell motility structures, and that PKC phosphorylation effects a conformational change that may enable AFAP-110 to promote actin filament cross-linking at the cell membrane. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The minimum structure of the Raf-1 serine/threonine kinase that recognizes active Ras was used to create a green fluorescent fusion protein (GFP) for monitoring Ras activation in live cells. In spite of its ability to bind activated Ras in vitro, the Ras binding domain (RBD) of Raf-1 (Raf-1[51-131]GFP) failed to detect Ras in Ras-transformed NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and required the addition of the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) (Raf-1[51-220]GFP) to show clear localization to plasma membrane ruffles. In normal NIH 3T3 cells, (Raf-1[51-220]GFP) showed minimal membrane localization that was enhanced after stimulation with platelet-derived growth factor or phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate. Mutations within either the RBD (R89L) or CRD (C168S) disrupted the membrane localization of (Raf-1[51-220]GFP), suggesting that both domains contribute to the recruitment of the fusion protein to Ras at the plasma membrane. The abilities of the various constructs to localize to the plasma membrane closely correlated with their inhibitory effects on mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase1 and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Membrane localization of full-length Raf-1-GFP was less prominent than that of (Raf-1[51-220]GFP) in spite of its strong binding to RasV12 and potent activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase. These finding indicate that both RBD and CRD are necessary to recruit Raf-1 to active Ras at the plasma membrane, and that these domains are not fully exposed in the Raf-1 molecule. Visualization of activated Ras in live cells will help to better understand the dynamics of Ras activation under various physiological and pathological conditions.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Exon discovery by genomic sequence alignment",
    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Motivation: During evolution, functional regions in genomic sequences tend to be more highly conserved than randomly mutating ‘junk DNA’ so local sequence similarity often indicates biological functionality. This fact can be used to identify functional elements in large eukaryotic DNA sequences by cross-species sequence comparison. In recent years, several gene-prediction methods have been proposed that work by comparing anonymous genomic sequences, for example from human and mouse. The main advantage of these methods is that they are based on simple and generally applicable measures of (local) sequence similarity; unlike standard gene-finding approaches they do not depend on species-specific training data or on the presence of cognate genes in data bases. As all comparative sequence-analysis methods, the new comparative gene-finding approaches critically rely on the quality of the underlying sequence alignments.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Results: Herein, we describe a new implementation of the sequence-alignment program DIALIGN that has been developed for alignment of large genomic sequences. We compare our method to the alignment programs PipMaker, WABA and BLAST and we show that local similarities identified by these programs are highly correlated to protein-coding regions. In our test runs, PipMaker was the most sensitive method while DIALIGN was most specific.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Availability: The program is downloadable from the DIALIGN home page at http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/dialign/</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Contact: burkhard@TechFak.Uni-Bielefeld.DE</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>* To whom correspondence should be addressed at Universität Bielefeld, Technische Fakultät, Praktische Informatik, Postfach 100131, 33501 Bielefeld, Germany.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This is an auspicious time for plant cell biology. We have the recent genome sequence of the model plant Arabidopsis, together with powerful new sets of tools that include functional genomics and the dynamic imaging of green fluorescent protein (GFP)–conjugated proteins by confocal microscopy. We are well placed indeed for uncovering the ways in which all genes act out their roles within individual cells. It is the combinatorial properties of these individual cells that underpin both the higherorder processes of plant growth and development and of plant evolution. At a crucial level in the hierarchy of explanations and structures, between the linear DNA sequence at one extreme and whole plant phenomena at the other, lies the cell. It is to this cellular level, to the irreducible unit of life, that this collection of papers is addressed, literally ‘between genome and plant’. Most of the major conceptual advances in our understanding of cell biology have come from work with animal and fungal systems. The ways in which membranes create dynamic compartments within cells and the role of the cytoskeleton in providing an ordering framework are familiar from the textbooks. But plant cells have special features.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Close, stable homolog juxtaposition during meiosis in budding yeast is dependent on meiotic recombination, occurs independently of synapsis, and is distinct from DSB-independent pairing contacts",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>A site-specific recombination system that probes the relative probabilities that pairs of chromosomal loci collide with one another in living cells of budding yeast was used to explore the relative contributions of pairing, recombination, synaptonemal complex formation, and telomere clustering to the close juxtaposition of homologous chromosome pairs during meiosis. The level of Cre-mediated recombination between a pair of <jats:italic>loxP</jats:italic> sites located at an allelic position on homologous chromosomes was 13-fold greater than that between a pair of <jats:italic>loxP</jats:italic> sites located at ectopic positions on nonhomologous chromosomes. Mutations affecting meiotic recombination initiation and the processing of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) into single-end invasions (SEIs) reduced the levels of allelic Cre-mediated recombination levels by three- to sixfold. The severity of Cre/<jats:italic>loxP</jats:italic> phenotypes is presented in contrast to relatively weak DSB-independent pairing defects as assayed using fluorescence in situ hybridization for these mutants. Mutations affecting synaptonemal complex (SC) formation or crossover control gave wild-type levels of allelic Cre-mediated recombination. A delay in attaining maximum levels of allelic Cre-mediated recombination was observed for a mutant defective in telomere clustering. None of the mutants affected ectopic levels of recombination. These data suggest that stable, close homolog juxtaposition in yeast is distinct from pre-DSB pairing interactions, requires both DSB and SEI formation, but does not depend on crossovers or SC.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Recognition of words and kaleidoscope pictures showed a double dissociation of left and right hippocampal activity using magnetic source imaging (MSI). MSI has advantages over alternative imaging techniques that measure hemodynamic changes for identifying regional changes in brain activity in real time and on an individual subject basis without the need for image subtraction. In this study, lists of words or kaleidoscope pictures were presented for memorization followed by tests of list items and foils during which brain activity was recorded. There was greater activation in the left than the right hippocampus with abstract nouns (e.g., relief) and greater activation in the right than the left hippocampus with kaleidoscope pictures. This dissociation was evident on a case by case basis. This study demonstrates the specialization of the two medial temporal lobe (MTL) regions, including the hippocampi, for mnemonic processing of verbal and pictorial items that are difficult to encode verbally.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>α-l-Arabinofuranosidases (α-Afs) are plant enzymes capable of releasing terminal arabinofuranosyl residues from cell wall matrix polymers, as well as from different glycoconjugates. Three different α-Af isoforms were distinguished by size exclusion chromatography of protein extracts from control tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum) and an ethylene synthesis-suppressed (ESS) line expressing an antisense 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic synthase transgene. α-Af I and II are active throughout fruit ontogeny. α-Af I is the first Zn-dependent cell wall enzyme isolated from tomato pericarp tissues, thus suggesting the involvement of zinc in fruit cell wall metabolism. This isoform is inhibited by 1,10-phenanthroline, but remains stable in the presence of NaCl and sucrose. α-Af II activity accounts for over 80% of the total α-Af activity in 10-d-old fruit, but activity drops during ripening. In contrast, α-Af III is ethylene dependent and specifically active during ripening. α-Af I released monosaccharide arabinose from KOH-soluble polysaccharides from tomato cell walls, whereas α-Af II and III acted on Na2CO3-soluble pectins. Different α-Af isoform responses to gibberellic acid, synthetic auxins, and ethylene were followed by using a novel ESS mature-green tomato pericarp disc system. α-Af I and II activity increased when gibberellic acid or 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid was applied, whereas ethylene treatment enhanced only α-Af III activity. Results suggest that tomato α-Afs are encoded by a gene family under differential hormonal controls, and probably have different in vivo functions. The ESS pericarp explant system allows comprehensive studies involving effects of physiological levels of different growth regulators on gene expression and enzyme activity with negligible wound-induced ethylene production.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The current experimental model for galactomannan biosynthesis in membrane-bound enzyme systems from developing legume-seed endosperms involves functional interaction between a GDP-mannose (Man) mannan synthase and a UDP-galactose (Gal) galactosyltransferase. The transfer specificity of the galactosyltransferase to the elongating mannan chain is critical in regulating the distribution and the degree of Gal substitution of the mannan backbone of the primary biosynthetic product. Detergent solubilization of the galactosyltransferase of fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum) with retention of activity permitted the partial purification of the enzyme and the cloning and sequencing of the corresponding cDNA with proof of functional identity. We now document the positional specificity of transfer of (14C)Gal from UDP-(14C)Gal to manno-oligosaccharide acceptors, chain lengths 5 to 8, catalyzed by the detergent-solubilized galactosyltransferase. Enzymatic fragmentation analyses of the labeled products showed that a single Gal residue was transferred per acceptor molecule, that the linkage was (1→6)-α, and that there was transfer to alternative Man residues within the acceptor molecules. Analysis of the relative frequencies of transfer to alternative Man residues within acceptor oligosaccharides of different chain length allowed the deduction of the substrate subsite recognition requirement of the galactosyltransferase. The enzyme has a principal recognition sequence of six Man residues, with transfer of Gal to the third Man residue from the nonreducing end of the sequence. These observations are incorporated into a refined model for enzyme interaction in galactomannan biosynthesis.</jats:p>",

Investigates the attitudes of management consulting employees towards e‐mail surveillance in a survey of work colleagues. Also considers e‐mail monitoring issues. Concludes that forms of workplace e‐mail monitoring are becoming more widespread. Awareness of the ramifications for worker privacy is growing, due partly to recent Government legislation. Finds that e‐mail policy adoption rates among management consultancies are comparatively low, as are levels of e‐mail scanning/surveillance software installation. Predicts that maintaining a fair balance between conflicting business and employee interests will be the key to determining the future direction of workplace e‐mail monitoring.</jats:p>",

Most readers of Arab online newspapers were male, students, professionals or business persons resident overseas, and were established, regular users of the Internet. For most, the Internet was regarded as an important news source and more than half the respondents claimed to read Arab online newspapers every day. Internet news was valued because it was readily available all the time, free of charge and provided a substitute for printed newspapers not available to them in their current location. The main problems were technical, linked to difficulty downloading or browsing content. The great majority (72 per cent) were satisfied with online newspapers. Frequency of reading electronic newspapers and overall satisfaction with online newspapers were predicted.</jats:p>",

Empirical evidence from Thessaly, a prefecture in central Greece where the first agri‐environmental measures in Greece were applied, shows that several factors can affect the farmers’ decision to participate. These factors refer mainly to the socio‐economic and farm characteristics of the surveyed farmers. Agricultural education/training of the farmers, the farm’s economic size, participation by neighbors or relatives, age and general education, can influence participation in the agri‐environmental measures, and more precisely in the Nitrate Reduction program. These variables were found also to be the main factors responsible for the extent of participation in terms of land allocation.</jats:p>",

There are only a few ecological farms in Romania and their products are exported to a large extent. In the future the spreading of ecological farms and of ecological agriculture will succeed in creating the conditions for an institutional framework which takes into account the regional ecological situation. The institutional framework must stimulate and sustain the Romanian agricultural producers in the development of this agriculture type, because there is an important external demand and, in addition, through educating Romanian consumers.</jats:p>",

The second section reviews the profession and role of the public analyst, in particular the history and development of the Society of Public Analysts. The next and longest section of the monograph is devoted to an interesting examination of food safety, nutrition and food manufacturing issues over the last 100 years. Many of the points raised are illustrated by excerpts from papers written in BFJ and included as Appendices to the monograph. Food irradiation was first raised as a subject in the journal in 1928! Bread and milk as staples in the British diet are looked at in some detail in terms of their ingredients and health properties. Some appendices have been included just for interest and provide brief snapshots of some of the main food concerns of the time, e.g. The Pure Food Society, the food we eat, food poisoning, a world food policy, the packaging of foods, food hygiene.

Interviews were also conducted with a sample of these museums to understand further the change process adopted. It was hypothesised that those organisations which were perceived by respondents to have achieved successful change outcomes, would have managed the change transition in accordance with generic change principles in the change literature, regardless of the legislated nature of the change. The findings provided strong support for these general principles of effective change management in situations where the organisation has little choice about the change initiative. However the legislated nature of the change and the initial lack of understanding of its scope and implications produced some deviations from these general principles, particularly with respect to the dimensions of visioning, participation and allocation of resources to the change program.</jats:p>",

A simulation modelling process is mainly based on feeding quantitative data into a model to produce quantitative results in a structured sequential process. Qualitative approaches to research take a less structured approach with more of an inclination towards judgmental and expert knowledge rather than hard data. In this paper the authors suggest that DES can be employed as both a qualitative and quantitative research tool. The paper demonstrates how simulation may represent both stances either separately or combined. This is based on the fact that the basic objectives of simulation are either for understanding – which needs a qualitative perspective – or performance measurement – which a needs quantitative perspective. Traditional quantitative and qualitative methods are discussed showing how DES might cope with the weaknesses of both stances. A structure for using DES as a combined research methodology is proposed.</jats:p>",

Then, during the early 1980s, Toyota’s highly effective JIT production system had a particular appeal to Americans who were trying to understand Japanese production methods. While Taichi Ohno, creator of Toyota’s production system, credits Henry Ford as the originator, it is now known that Ernest Kanzler, one of Ford’s subordinates, played a major role in developing JIT production methods.

The paper attempts to expand the simplistic idea that organisational learning is an adaptive approach supported by individualized and stand‐alone strategies of learning and demonstrates how various conventions of learning can be understood as integrated learning cycles, from which organisations can chart new paradigms of learning in practice. Current theories of organizational learning are imbued with their own sense of history making, clever manifestos that support a workshop or case study approach, and questionable rather than empirical validations of an internally consistent phenomenon. Existing theories of learning, however, are valuable to the extent that they collectively represent a community of practice from which scholars and practitioners benefit. New conceptual approaches are needed, however, to link current practices and empirical observation, so that individualized approaches to organizational learning can be integrated.</jats:p>",

The sample for this study consisted of 185 large publicly‐held US‐based corporations which announced their intentions to downsize during the period 1990‐1992. Over the subsequent ten‐year period (1992‐2001) their returns on investment were obtained and the empirical relationship between downsizing and long‐run profitability was determined. Whether organizations that undergo this type of change appear to be better off than they were before they implemented the process was the focus of this study. The study ascertained that downsizing does not appear to be in the best long‐term interest of the corporation, its employees, or its shareholders, and that the massive job cuts did not lead to strong sustained gains in the price of the stock. Many organizational benefits fail to develop as expected and the benefits are elusive. The findings of this study suggest downsizing does not engender a long‐run productivity gain and it fails as a method to boost shareholder value.</jats:p>",

Emphasis is given to the problem of integrating and co‐ordinating capital investment activities and to important linkages with the strategic planning process. The model is structured according to the principles of contingency theory. The process configuration depends on a set of exogenous variables which influence the choice of analytical tools and organizational patterns.

Notes that despite the fact that some have called centralized systems electronic dinosaurs, many companies are turning to this traditional approach because it does offer one thing that decentralized systems generally lack, namely, control. Cites results indicating that information technology structure (centralized versus decentralized) is strongly related to management equity ownership, concentration of stock holdings, and the level of turbulence which firms face. Notes, for example, that an organization where top executives and managers own a relatively high percentage of the company’s stock possesses a more centralized IT structure than an organization with a relatively lower percentage of management ownership. Points out that this means that user departments in the latter have more control over their IT functions than do users in the former, but that, on the other hand, companies with high levels of stock concentration have more decentralized IT structures. In addition, concludes that the research revealed a statistically positive significant relationship between the level of turbulence firms face and the degree of IT centralization.</jats:p>",

The three case studies analyse factors in decision making processes at different stages and relating to different aspects of facilities management, including re‐planning, relocation and development in IT use. Although there are clear differences in the organisations and the foci of the projects, the issues of expert intervention and the nature of communication cross cut the different cases. Through reflection on three iterations of expert intervention, the basic model of power/knowledge/communications is criticised and developed in such a way as to redistribute responsibilities and power, and hence to encourage knowledge‐focused communication. The emergent model is not one which will be comfortably accepted by all the parties, since it challenges the mystique of the expert as provider of knowledge inputs, the role of the manager as holder of power, and the user as being devoid of responsibility.</jats:p>",

Superior firms typically do not do just one thing well, they often excel in multiple aspects. Nurturing an evolving constellation of multiple advantages and undertaking timely renewals help carry the firm through competition over time. To maintain healthy dynamics of a firm’s constellation of advantage, the following tasks should be carefully attended to: establishment of dominant advantage which defines the firm’s core purpose and identity; accumulation of supporting advantages to complete the constellation; amplification of complementary advantages for maximum performance; trade‐off among competing advantages for long‐term viability; and renewal of both dominant and supporting advantages, in adaptation to changes in the firm, competition, and the general environment. Knowledge of the relationship between and interaction of multiple advantages is essential for managing a firm’s advantage constellation, a critical challenge facing general managers.</jats:p>",

It was hypothesised that those organisations which were assessed by respondents to have achieved successful change outcomes would also have managed the change process in accordance with general guidelines on effective change in the change literature. The general guidelines largely recommend a consultative or participative style of leadership as being most effective for leading change. Recent contingency models relating change leadership style to change strategy predict that participative leadership styles are not always appropriate or effective for leading change, and that under circumstances, exceptions to the general guidelines would apply. However, it was argued that due to the nature of museums as professional bureaucracies, such exceptions are unlikely to occur for the organisations studied in this paper. The findings provided strong support for these general principles of effective change management.</jats:p>",

The range of work is little changed; employees exercise little in the way of new skills; they appear reluctant to adopt responsibility for the work of others; and the performance management system operates on the basis of individual performance. Nonetheless, teamworking appears to work in the Inland Revenue. It does so by having a team rather than an individual allocation of work, and by encouraging individual identity with the team target. This suggests that, although a limited version of teamworking exists, this might be all an organization needs.

Built on the assumptions that people actively construct their “organisational world” and that language is central to these processes of social construction, HRM is treated as a discursive resource that can be used by managers to persuade employees to accept a particular world view of organisational change. Drawing upon a private sector case study, the article highlights important implications on the use of HRM rhetoric not addressed by conventional research designs concerned with notions of “strategic fit” and “best practice”. Here organisations are treated as being part of an objective reality that can be “measured” using some kind of statistical analysis. This article challenges assumptions underpinning these designs and examines the potential of discourse theory to develop richer insights into questions about the practicalities and ethics of managing meaning at the workplace.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Not only is multifunctionality regarded as an indispensable design feature of team‐based work, being multifunctional is allegedly beneficial for employees, and it is presumed to increase job satisfaction and commitment. In this article we argue that multifunctionality also has its downsides and propose a framework in which multifunctionality is associated with ineffective utilisation of human resources. We incorporate examples from the empirical literature to depict sources of ineffective utilisation in teams. Depending on the managerial policies in force and the social dynamics within teams, multifunctionality can lead to both underutilisation of skills and overutilisation of capacity (task overload). By drawing on a range of literature, this article gives reason for more scepticism concerning the alleged universal benefits of multifunctionality, and suggests a framework as a starting point for further research.</jats:p>",

Indexes were compared for their coverage of a core list of 135 anthropology journals as well as journals relevant to anthropology in other social science disciplines. In addition to journal coverage, several index characteristics were also compared: years of coverage; timeliness; extent of indexing; record structure; search software; and availability of controlled vocabulary, abstracts and full text.

Considerations about epistemology and ontology and their consequences for the research are not integrated in the tradition. Just as daily research only very seldom relates to higher‐level theorising, a case in point being the development of a common theoretical framework, theoretical discussions are mostly separated from daily research into special rooms where discussion and development takes places among a few specialists. The industrial relations tradition also keeps women and research in gender in the periphery. This has consequences not only for the visibility of women’s labour market participation and for the status of the research in gender, but also for the industrial relations tradition, as it will become less able to see new tendencies and developments at the labour market and in industrial relations. The first part of the article discusses how the tradition – in spite of a growing acceptance of gender research – is still influenced by a male norm. In the second part the article endeavours to relate the under‐theorising of the IR tradition and the marginalisation of a gender perspective. The last part of the article introduces an integrated gender perspective as one – although incomplete – way to overcome these problems.</jats:p>",

It comes to the conclusion that the unemployment observed since 1991 is not simply a consequence of a deterioration in the functioning of the Swiss labour market compared with earlier periods, but rather a result of changes in immigration policies and also the reflection in the statistics of a truer picture of the labour market imbalance created by the restructuring of the economy.</jats:p>",

The first two models make opposite predictions regarding the trade‐off between working‐hour constraints and job tenure. The third model makes a prediction regarding the potential effect of the unemployment rate on the extent of working‐time constraints. Results indicate, first, that neither model of lifetime contracting (specific‐capital and agency) explains the observed extent of working‐hour constraints. Second, it is found that the unemployment rate confronting the worker in his or her labour market constitutes an obvious incentive to work more hours than he or she wants.</jats:p>",

However, over the last decade the number of such opportunities have started to decline and many more workers are participating in “non‐standard” forms of employment. Using data from the UK’s Labour Force Survey, and the Canadian General Social Survey, this paper traces the trends in “non‐standard” employment over the 1989 to 1994 period. The findings illustrate that, although the majority of workers are still in full‐time permanent jobs, an increasing proportion are engaged in “non‐standard” employment. The paper suggests that certain groups are more likely to be involved in “non‐standard” employment than others, and that increasingly these tend to be made up of workers at one end or other of the working age spectrum.</jats:p>",

There have been much theoretical work and some case studies in this domain. This paper reports part of a major study in the area. A key stage in this work has been an empirical study of UK manufacturing to investigate a broad range of issues surrounding manufacturing operations and strategic flexibility. In part this has been carried out through a questionnaire survey. This paper summarises some of the principal findings. These include respondents’ descriptions of their business strategies, the part played by manufacturing, the interfaces with customers, and the role of the information system and its contribution to manufacturing. This is complemented by a summary of 32 interviews/case histories which allow these issues to be explored further and which provide the input to the subsequent stages of the overall project.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The Australian government welcomed globalisation and led the way with tariff reductions, claiming that many local manufacturers were inefficient and inward looking as a result of over protection. This paper reports on a series of interviews conducted in companies belonging to the (small) electrical appliances and household kitchenware industries, which both face fierce competition from imported goods. The objectives were to find out what business and manufacturing strategies have sustained them in the new trade environment. Six distinct strategies were identified, although a mix is common. There has been a real push to increase productivity, but it is not enough on its own to enable a firm to defend its domestic market against cheap imports. The main impact of globalisation has been a move to replace local sources of production with others located offshore. Typically, these are independent suppliers in China operating under contract manufacturing agreements.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The paper argues that the widespread changes in manufacturing industry are best conceptualised as paradigmatic, in that they constitute a patterned reconfiguration of ideas, beliefs and values about manufacturing philosophy, strategy, structure, organisation and operations. The widespread adoption of teamworking is part of this patterning and is argued to reflect a new institutional form of manufacturing organisation. In investigating teamworking, the paper uses the concept of organisational archetypes to investigate whether or not teamworking takes a single, or variety of interlocking forms. Empirical studies are introduced to justify the articulation of three teamworking forms: a “‘self‐directed” archetypal form and two other sub‐types, “lean” and “project”, neither of which, it is argued, are truly archetypal. The paper concludes that broad institutional changes toward a teamworked manufacturing organisation impact on the “interpretive schema” of managers operating in specific task environments who prescribe and deploy this new organisational format. This creates the two hybrid sub‐types in practice. The findings of this research have implications for both practitioners involved in designing and introducing teamworking into manufacturing firms, and for academics researching on team based organisational design.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Many companies have adopted electronic data interchange (EDI), often with results inconsistent with the expectations of the company. In these instances, it is often the mismatch between expectations and the company’s activities undertaken to achieve the desired performance gain that fuels their dissatisfaction with EDI. This same mismatch often causes academic research into EDI and supply chain management to lose focus. This article presents a framework of EDI benefits in a supply chain management context that can be used to match a company’s EDI efforts with its desired outcomes from EDI use. The framework states that two critical factors to understanding EDI’s impact on supply chain management are the span of management control of the business process in question and whether EDI directly or indirectly influences that same business process. The proposed framework is then used to develop a research agenda for EDI and supply chain management. We suggest possible directions for research methods, measure development and hypothesis generation that can be used in future research studies.</jats:p>",

It also outlines the development of a framework for technology valuation. The survey results indicate that the value of product technology is related to superior technical performance, especially on reliability and functionality, and the prospects of premium prices and increased sales of the technology transfer based machine tools. Access to markets is the main objective of UK companies, while Chinese companies are concerned about improving their technological capability. There are significant risks, especially related to performance in the market, and while owners and acquirers have benefited in the short term, the long term collaboration required for strategic benefits has been difficult to achieve because of the different priorities of the owners and the acquirers.</jats:p>",

However, once implemented, JIT is fraught with numerous types of uncertainties, including variations in processing time and demand, planned interruptions such as preventive maintenance and unplanned interruptions such as equipment failure. These uncertainties lead to lowered production throughput, decreased machine utilization, increased order completion time and greater backlogs and overtime requirements. In this paper, we introduce a newly developed system, which we refer to as the flexible kanban system (FKS), to cope with uncertainties and planned/unplanned interruptions. We demonstrate the superiority of the new system by considering four case examples covering various uncertainties, conducting numerous studies and comparing the overall performances of the FKS with that of the traditional JIT system. In all the cases considered, the performance of the FKS was, indeed, superior to that of the traditional JIT system.</jats:p>",

A set of audit tools for assessing the responsiveness of production operations is being prepared as part of an EPSRC funded investigation. These tools are based on the idea that the ability to respond is linked to: the nature of the disturbances or changes requiring a response; their impact on production goals; and the inherent response capabilities of the operation. These response capabilities include information gathering and processing (to detect disturbances and production conditions), decision processes (which initiate system responses to disturbances) and various types of process flexibilities and buffers (which provide the physical means of dealing with disturbances). The paper discusses concepts and issues associated with production responsiveness, describes the audit tools that have been developed and illustrates their use in the context of a steel manufacturing plant.</jats:p>",

For these advanced manufacturing systems the dependence on human competence is greater. However, previous studies indicate that the human aspects for successfully implementing such systems have been neglected. The objective here is to test the hypotheses that system complexity is inversely related to performance, and that training of system operators, and the quality of the man/machine interface reduces the negative impact of system complexity. A sample of discreet manufacturing systems from 128 organizations was used to test these hypotheses empirically. Moderated multivariate regression indicates that man/machine interfaces are significant contributors to reducing the negative effect of systems complexity. With a lower level of significance, operator training has a similar impact. For complex manufacturing systems software, it behoves managers to insure that the man/machine interface provides the desirable features outlined in this study.</jats:p>",

First, using a VAR modelling technique with suitable diagnostics, e.g. Akaike’s FPE statistics and a likelihood ratio test for over‐ and under‐fitting the causal model, the results indicate a positive unidirectional causality flowing from defence spending to economic growth. Second, by evaluating a dynamic vector error‐correction model, variance decomposition and impulse response functions, then analyses the direction, duration and strength of Granger‐causality between defence spending and economic growth. The results broadly indicate that defence spending and economic growth did share a common trend over the sample period under analysis, but it was the former which stimulated the latter. Moreover, it is defence spending that has a much more perceptible and prolonged effect on economic growth, giving rise to implications that although expenditure on defence may have been politically motivated, over the long‐run this spending did play a significant indirect role in enhancing the growth potential of this, for many years, closed‐door economy.</jats:p>",

Although the TFPG of most services were dismal during 1976‐93, the rates were higher for the post‐1985 recession period, compared with those in the pre‐1985 recession years. This trend reflects the Government’s concerted efforts to upgrade the workforce and promote higher technology services. Besides, the service industries which did not conform to this trend had in common massive infrastructural investments which were primarily undertaken by government‐linked enterprises with a longer‐term interest of the economy at large. Thus it seems that the paternal role of government has a vital influence on Singapore’s TFPG performance.

The theory of firm resources currently spans much of the industrial organisation (IO) and strategic management literature. In some fields, e.g. diversification, it has already acquired dominant status. Despite significant progress in TCE there still seem to remain significant unresolved issues. Indeed we claim that transaction cost economics fail to supply convincing answers to the issues of the nature of the firm (why do firms exist?), and their essence (running a business). It offers a partial explanation of the “nature” and little on the “essence”. The resource value view complements the nature side and goes far beyond on the essence issue. It provides a fruitful starting point for an integrative framework. This, we suggest, should be based on the resource value perspective story and craft (dynamic) transaction costs in the ensuing evolutionary tale.</jats:p>",

However, middle managers perceived more changes than front‐line workers in terms of working relationships with employees, job responsibility and participation in decision making.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Australia began a comprehensive process of federal civil service reform in the 1970s, culminating in the introduction of a set of ambitious administrative reforms in the 1980s. Faced with the challenges of reform implementation, the traditional approach to public management development in the Australian Public Service (APS) was found wanting. By the end of the 1980s it was broadly accepted within the APS that the correct management development path to follow involved the articulation of management competences. The next challenge was to determine how best to inculcate these desired competences. Public management education emerged as one strategy. By placing emphasis on civil servants’ management competences, however, public management education compounds the risk that civil servants may become less able, even less willing, to understand and address the complexities of the regulatory and accountability regimes, and the ethical challenges created by the juxtaposition of administrative power with ambiguity, complexity and indeterminacy. All of these affect, if not govern, the way they must manage.</jats:p>",

They must be aware of organizational nuances as well as external influences that may impair their interpersonal decision‐making ability. Organizations often provide a coach for executives who are having trouble with change and are in need of more effective leadership strategies. The process of coaching offers a fresh perspective for understanding and affecting organizational processes and individual behavior. A strategic position is taken when the coach gathers information, interacts with the environment, reframes information, and assists the executive in acting on pressing circumstances. The coaching process is a critical aspect of organizational development. Coaching helps the executive focus on objectives, develops resiliency, and builds interpersonal savvy. This article explores the key elements of effective coaching, a surprisingly overlooked aspect of organizational change. Steps are outlined in the coaching process and examples are given on how the process works. A case is made for executive coaching as important leverage for organizational transformation.</jats:p>",

An intelligent building is one in which the building fabric, space, services and information systems can respond efficiently to the initial and changing demands of the owner, the occupier and the environment. A structured and holistic approach must be used to minimize the cost of ownership and to ensure that the building most aptly meets the needs of the company. Looks at the role of networked systems and cable systems in buildings and identifies the principal characteristics required of them. Discusses some of the latest thinking regarding the integration of these networks and shows a practical arrangement that will achieve this.

Promulgation of the socialist market economy and the recent reforms in national healthcare industry have compelled impetuses for change in the distribution systems, forms of investment of multinational pharmaceutical companies, and product/market strategies. The conventional wisdom on pioneer marketing may be challenged by these situations in the PRC. This study examines four markets that encompass both specialty and general pharmaceuticals so as to explore whether there is a product category effect on entry strategies. The findings indicate a possible synergistic effect of product category and order of entry. In addition, product life cycle has a direct impact on order of entry whereas brand position has an effect on product category. Both government policies and corporate strategies have implications on product categories and order of entry. The recent reforms in China have helped to build a foundation for pharmaceutical companies to conduct business in a manner that is similar to that of the developed countries. The entry strategies for pharmaceuticals may therefore involve more complicated considerations in accordance with these new arrangements in the legal and regulatory environments. Further research into relationships among these variables and the mediation effect is therefore indicated.</jats:p>",

The paper commences with a discussion of broad issues facing contemporary research in marketing communications and strongly suggests that multidisciplinary approaches may offer greater insight than unidisciplinary ones. The authors then briefly, and selectively, introduce questions concerning the psychological assumptions underpinning theoretical work in marketing communications and speculate on implications these assumptions may have for a consumer psychology of IMC. The final strand of the argument considers the cognitivist notion of social cognition and contrasts this with the social constructionist view with regard to theoretical implications both views may have for a psychology of integrated marketing communications.

Empirical studies that evaluate the impact of the process on the IS department are needed to help organizations better manage their information technologies and systems. This study investigates the real impacts of IS downsizing on the IS department as perceived by IS managers of those companies whose IS had been downsized. With a pre‐tested survey instrument, the study compares 12 critical characteristics of 98 IS departments before and after the downsizing process. The gains and drawbacks of IS downsizing are also analysed based on key indicators that are emphasized in the literature. The results indicate that IS downsizing has definite benefits and drawbacks. The findings also show that the net gains on some of the key indicators are not as significant as the IS downsizing proponents may claim.</jats:p>",

Mail survey data obtained from 125 manufacturing firms in the USA that had adopted a wide variety of AMT are used in this analysis. On average, these firms had placed the highest levels of importance on improving product quality, reducing manufacturing leadtimes, reducing per unit production costs and improving responsiveness to changing customer needs. Lower levels of importance were reported for the market‐based objectives of increasing market share and gaining earlier entrance to market. In addition, although firms had also ascribed lower levels of importance to the organizational adaptation benefits of developing an integrated organization and developing management expertise, they were satisfied that implementation of the technologies had a positive influence on achieving these benefits. Exploratory factor analysis revealed that the 15 benefits that were investigated in this study can be viewed as representing three interdependent dimensions: technical/operational objectives, total quality management‐based objectives, and business or marketing‐based objectives. </jats:p>",

Non‐US foreign direct investment, particularly from Asian and European companies, is a current trend in maquiladoras. A cluster concept is now developed among new maquiladoras from Asia and Europe to remain competitive in an increasingly price‐sensitive market, to maintain consistent quality standards in a high‐volume environment, and to fulfill the NAFTA’s rules of origin provision. Maquiladora production is now shifting from lower‐skilled, labor‐intensive assembly to advanced production technologies. Obstacles still remain in Mexico’s infrastructure and regulations to its market.

We then examined its relevance in offering active scanning support to managers. An agent‐based support system is proposed. Useful software agents needed to constitute the system are identified.

The input impact, which can be either plane waves or non‐plane waves, can either be forces acting directly on the fluid–structure system or be explosion sources in the fluid. The far field or near field explosion sources, which are difficult to be simulated for finite element analysis, are very easy to be simulated here by boundary element modeling as internal sources. The stability problem is solved by using the linear <jats:italic>θ</jats:italic> method, which makes the BEM scheme stable.

Contrary to prior evidence, CO does appear to be an important informational cue for consumers of services; CO effects were found to be stronger than brand effects for quality and attitude ratings, while brand was more significantly correlated with purchase intentions. A positive CO image compensated for a weak brand, suggesting that, where applicable, marketing efforts should emphasize an association with a positive CO perception. Conversely, a strong brand was not found to compensate for a negative CO perception; in this case, it would be appropriate to change the associated CO to one with a more positive image, as at least one major cruise line has already done.</jats:p>",

Some bank clients believe in the benefits of partnering with one or two marketing research suppliers. Other bank clients are concerned that partnering with researchers will breed complacency, thus increasing research costs and decreasing quality. Attempts to examine the impact of partnering and non‐partnering relationships on the research firms’ performance in three areas: service quality, product quality and overall customer satisfaction. Empirical evidence indicates a positive relationship between partnering and increased client satisfaction in all three areas.</jats:p>",

Sets out the reasons why banks have traditionally applied monolithic identity systems and eschewed explicit branding, and presents Midland’s reasons for challenging that paradigm ‐ chiefly the nature of its group structure and its desire to segment its personal market more effectively. While the Midland approach was not a commercial success, it provides some general lessons which help to inform corporate identity theory in general and financial sector identity and branding theory in particular. These include the need for identity to be contingent on strategy, the importance of “soft” as well as “hard” identity features, the conflicts between different identity systems (e.g. firm‐specific versus industry‐generic) and the problems of applying branding theory to products which are in essence no more than contracts.</jats:p>",

As these two developments intertwine, many organizations in the sector may therefore need to consider desktop icons as an emerging customer interface. Reviews the economic argument for virtual communities as the first viable Internet value‐creation model to combine content and communication. Drawing from practical experience with pioneering virtual community developments, and a consideration of direct and indirect financial service delivery channels, the conclusion is reached that many companies in the sector now face an important, strategic choice in the development of their on‐line presence. For most, this will be between deciding to act rapidly to build their own virtual community, or instead opting for a more effective third party, virtual community “inhabitation strategy”.</jats:p>",

Here FMECA is approached as a multi‐criteria decision making technique which integrates four different factors: chance of failure, chance of non‐detection, severity, and expected cost. To aid the analyst to formulate an efficient and effective priority ranking of the possible causes of failure, the analytic hierarchy process technique is adopted. With this technique, factors and alternative causes of failure are arranged in a hierarchic structure and evaluated only through the use of a series of pairwise judgements. With this new approach to failure investigation, the critical FMECA problem concerning the (direct) evaluation of failure factors is also by‐passed. The principles of the theory and an actual application in an Italian refrigerator manufacturing company are reported in the paper.</jats:p>",

Since the interrelationship among quality cost components is complex, a general quantitative model for describing their relationship is not easy to construct for improving the quality. In the assessments of quality cost, some hidden quality costs, such as the goodwill loss due to lost customers’ reliability, are often neglected in the existing analysis methods. This may lead to reaching a sub‐optimal decision. In addition, the assessments of quantitative quality cost items are usually approximated, and therefore are imprecise in nature. Based on these considerations, we propose fuzzy approaches to evaluate quality improvement alternatives because of its fuzzy nature. An evidence fusion technique, namely Choquet fuzzy integral, is employed to aggregate the quality cost information. A composite index is determined to find the best quality improvement alternative. Finally, a numerical example is used to demonstrate the applicability of the approach.</jats:p>",

However, the daunting task of creating a teamwork environment within many companies is often left to pro‐active senior management that assumes the responsibility for creating a culture of interdependency. The opportunity for maximising employee potential through empowered teamwork represents a challenge for many managers. These managers who often become champions for success inevitably contribute towards improving organisational performance through re‐engineering the people process. This paper describes a reflective case experience of a small to medium enterprise that developed a team‐based organisation, where all employees were empowered to challenge the status quo, implement continuous improvement strategies and, thus, strive towards TQM. The paper describes how the formation of self‐directed work teams (SDWTs) is used as a strategy for motivating a diverse group of people with different attitudes, skills and personalities, to work together towards common business goals. Particularly, emphasis is placed on the role of the team facilitator within dynamic teams, and the necessary attributes of such a facilitator are identified. This identification also assists in providing an understanding of how a facilitator can assist in curtailing conflict.

However, these methods have made relatively little inroads into the service industries, for rather obscure reasons. Develops a robust experimental design to study the variabilities of a service process, namely, a customer complaint correction process, used by a small export company. The goal of the study is to reduce system response time to failures resulting from human or equipment error, equipment malfunction or damage, or unspecified abnormalities in the hardware or software modules of the system. Successfully identifies factors that affected the system response time in a statistically significant manner and yielded the optimum combination of factor levels that produce best results as measured in terms of system response time. Also demonstrates the usefulness and applicability of Taguchi methods in a service environment ‐ thus chipping away at the myth that Taguchi methods work only in a manufacturing environment.</jats:p>",

For the most part, air pollution is a negative side‐effect of industrial development. As such, it primarily concerns industrialized countries. However, it has also great impact on those countries in the developing world that have steady growth in industrial development. Taiwan is one of the developing countries that has to deal with this problem. Air pollution is not just an environmental problem, but also a social problem. It has a particular impact, for example, on the quality of inventory. Discusses and demonstrates the application of a statistical method for studying the effect of air pollution on the quality of inventory and how results can be used to reduce costs. Provides a method to resolve the air pollution problem that pertains to the quality of inventory using a scientific approach. Since most of the enterprises in Taiwan are small or medium‐sized enterprises, the application of statistical methods such as the ANOVA model or regression techniques are not common. However, these statistical methods do have application for small or medium enterprises. Employs a statistical method using a sample of data collected from an aluminium extrusion plant in Taiwan.

Based on a survey of 232 manufacturing firms in the USA and Canada, analyses the role of supervisors in TQM and non‐TQM firms using eight quality constructs. Major results indicate that, as compared with non‐TQM firms, supervisors in TQM firms receive more support and encouragement from top management, are under less tension, and possess a higher level of satisfaction. Also, participation of supervisors in the firm’s quality efforts is higher in TQM firms. The higher level of supervisors’ involvement, coupled with the top management commitment, results in higher quality of manufacturing processes and products for TQM firms than non‐TQM firms. Further, when implementing TQM strategies, non‐unionized firms are found to provide a better work environment for supervisors than the unionized firms.</jats:p>",

The survey findings indicate that CBT usage to support quality in Hong Kong is low, particularly ESs and ANNs. This is partly due to a lack of awareness regarding the potential of CBTs in supporting quality among their potential users, and partly because of a lack of availability of suitable software to support their use. This paper represents a first attempt to examine the real‐life use of CBTs in support of quality. Based on the research findings, we have identified several opportunities for further research and suggested a number of research directions for CBTs to support “quality”in practice.</jats:p>",

These measures deal with the descriptions of an individual’s behaviour as well as others’ behaviour towards a specific person. The items within each measure also probe evaluative ratings of several specific group processes and outcomes. Evaluates the relationship between the process variables and a dependent performance variable ‐ the profit achieved by groups in a marketing simulation game ‐ in an attempt to shed further light on the group process in strategic marketing decision making. A factor analysis reveals a reasonably close concurrence of the experimental data and that of the Green and Taber instrument, leading to the conclusion that the two sets of data were of a similar structure. Attempts to establish a relationship between the Green and Taber process variables and profit. Concludes that negative socio‐emotional behaviour and solution satisfaction are positively related to group success. Therefore, the opportunities for negative socio‐emotional behaviours such as rejecting others’ positions, arguing and criticizing seem to be worthy of exploration. Since solution satisfaction returned a significant regression, finds that the give‐and‐take arguments of socio‐emotional behaviour contributed to solution satisfaction.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Managing survivors The experience of survivors in British Telecom and the British financial services sector",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Explains that the extent and pace of change throughout British industry has been increasingly dramatically, resulting in major job losses, and the remaining employees or survivors of such change often experience the effects as deeply as those who are made redundant. Notes that, although many organizations invest time and resource in exiting people, they do little to help those who stay, and yet the successful transformation of organizations relies heavily on managing these people through the transitions. Examines data from a case study of British Telecom and survey data from the financial services sector. Illustrates, from the combination of case and survey data, the impact of such organizational change on the survivors. Indicates that few organizations appear to provide structured help at the appropriate level and intensity. Suggests that organizations will have to do more for their survivors to establish a new psychological contract.</jats:p>",

Enquires whether university teachers can be meaningfully grouped on the basis of the satisfaction levels which they enjoy on various aspects of their jobs. Using a cluster analytical procedure, groups university teachers in the UK into three: happy workers, satisfied workers and unhappy workers. While the happy workers (67 per cent) and the satisfied workers (14 per cent) form a majority of the workforce, offers suggestions on how to reduce the percentage of unhappy workers (19 per cent) in higher education. In particular, focuses attention on this newer, and possibly very useful, approach of classifying workers, instead of the traditional method based on the criterion of rank alone. Discusses the implications of this new approach for grouping workers.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The importance of corporate wellness programmes has been recognized by many countries. It is only in recent years that organizations in Singapore have begun to implement wellness programmes on an organization‐wide scale. This is also in line with the Singapore Government’s recent emphasis on healthy lifestyle and health campaigns for the public. Thus, there is a growing trend for organizations in Singapore to offer wellness programmes. Attempts to establish the benefits which may be reaped from such investment. Describes how findings from the study indicate that employees in organizations with wellness programmes generally have a more positive attitude towards their organizations, express higher job satisfaction and satisfaction with the fringe benefits provided for them. However, no significant differences were found between employees in organizations with and without wellness programmes in terms of level of work stress, self‐reported absenteeism rates, satisfaction with working conditions, co‐worker relations and accomplishment. As employees are becoming more health conscious, given the benefits of the wellness programmes, recommends that management should not hesitate to adopt health promotion activities in the workplace.</jats:p>",

In‐depth interviews were conducted with 16 Thai managers in the Siam Cement Group. Managers who viewed themselves as vision setters tended to use rational persuasion, consultation, and pressure most. Motivator managers used rationality and ingratiation. Analyzer managers used pressure. Task masters used rationality and pressure. However, all types of manager sometimes used other tactics besides the most common ones. Much of this behavior is similar to how managers in studies from the USA behaved. However, Thai managers showed some orientation toward “softer” methods, whether or not the managerial role is typically associated with “soft” or “hard” methods.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Human drives are well and truly present in organizations and undergo different vicissitudes. In the management of human resources, these vicissitudes emblematically take the form of modes of primary defence against the drives solicited by an increasingly restrictive labour market. Neither the fact that cases of abuse (guilt) do occur, nor the connivance that can exist amongst employees, diminishes the responsibility of directors of human resources (DHR) and researchers in this domain. Information, decision, arbitration and implementation can be seen here to define the fourfold process of inversion by which drives are transformed into their opposite. In the shift from activity to passivity, the repressed is never far away. Indeed, the return of the repressed implies a certain detour of the unconscious: namely an acting out that takes the form of a reversal onto the person’s own self. A good DHR is one that must disappear! Which furnishes us with a fine example of sadism turned upon the self, as in the self‐punishing of the obsessional neurotic.</jats:p>",
